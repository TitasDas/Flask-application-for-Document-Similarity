NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Global equity markets rose to a new high on Friday as U.S. consumer spending in July suggested a strong economic rebound lies ahead, while the Japanese yen surged on safe-haven buying after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe resigned for health reasons. 
The dollar approached lows last seen in May 2018, retreating from Thursday when the Federal Reserve set forth a new stance on inflation that will allow it to run a bit hot and reinforced expectations of a prolonged low interest-rate environment. 
Longer-term yields fell and gold rose more than 2% as investors sought a store of value in the face of higher inflation and real rates that are negative. 
U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected last month, raising expectations for a sharp rebound in growth in the third quarter, though momentum could ebb as the COVID-19 pandemic lingers and fiscal stimulus dries up. 
A U.S. Commerce Department report also showed a rise in personal income after two straight monthly declines, while monthly inflation pushed higher. 
“There’s a big bounce on Main Street, the economic data every day on Main Street is bouncing higher,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. 
People are getting more optimistic about the economy but underneath that is a healthy dose of caution as “Main Street is still a mess,” he said. 
“As the market keeps going up, more and more of them are reducing their bearish bets a little bit and putting more into stocks, which is helping drive the market higher,” he said. 
MSCI’s benchmark for global equity markets rose 0.43% to 585.73 after earlier setting a new intraday high, while stocks on Wall Street also rallied, with technology leading the way and the Dow close to an all-time high. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.54%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.45% and the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite added 0.49%. 
“A lot of this is momentum. It’s just fear of being left behind, fear of missing out,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. 
“Value has been outperforming growth and you’re seeing that reverse today. When growth underperforms for a period of days, it tends to rebound very sharply. We’re seeing that in market preferences today.” 
Information technology rose 0.9% and accounted for about half of the S&amp;P 500’s gain. 
In Europe, stocks slipped as investors dumped this year’s outperformers, including technology and healthcare stocks, and bid up banking shares after the Fed unveiled its new policy framework. 
The broad pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index slid 0.50% to close at 1,429.82. 
In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 share index closed down 1.4% while the yen, seen as a safe-haven currency to buy in times of uncertainty, strengthened 1.03% versus the greenback at 105.46 per dollar. 
The yen was on course for its biggest one-day jump since March, when the coronavirus pandemic roiled global markets. 
There has been speculation about Abe’s health all week but the resignation of Japan’s longest-serving premier rattled investors, given he has spearheaded efforts to revive growth through his reflationary “Abenomics” policies. 
Some analysts said the yen’s rally seemed excessive given Abe’s successor was unlikely to alter economic policy significantly because Japan remains in the middle of a battle to avoid deflation and lift growth. 
“You’re seeing yen strength on a little bit of uncertainty,” said Lou Brien, strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. “Abenomics has been one of the more influential economic strategies.” 
The dollar index fell 0.657%, while the euro rose 0.53% to $1.1884. 
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note pared losses to trade down 1.3 basis points to 0.7326%. Investors are rebalancing intermediate-dated debt following large auctions earlier this week. 
U.S. Treasury auctions of roughly $150 billion worth of three-year, five-year and seven-year notes received strong demand starting on Tuesday. The decline in yields on each of those instruments on Friday likely reflected traders repositioning, said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy for Societe Generale. 
German bond yields briefly rose to their highest since early June after the Fed’s decision to target average inflation. 
Oil prices slid a notch after Hurricane Laura passed the heart of the U.S. oil industry in Louisiana and Texas without causing widespread damage and companies began to restart operations. 
Brent crude futures settled down 4 cents at $45.05 a barrel and U.S. crude futures slipped 7 cents to settle at $42.97 a barrel. 
U.S. gold futures settled up 2.2% at 1,974.90 an ounce.

US death toll tops 180,000; new hotspots emerge in Midwest
The coronavirus toll in the United States topped 180,000 Thursday as officials braced for another surge as schools are reopening. Several US Midwest states reported record single-day spikes as governors said they would not reduce testing as recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
On Thursday, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota all recorded their biggest one-day increases in new infections since the pandemic began. Although nationally new cases, deaths and positivity rates are on decline, new hotspots are emerging in the country’s Midwest.

As a stringent lockdown in Australia’s second most populous state has been in place, Victoria is expected to report fewer than 100 cases a day, authorities said on Friday. Victoria state authorities said they had detected 113 new cases in the past 24 hours, unchanged from the previous day, and below the one-day record of 725 cases reported in early August.
“Its not gotten below 100 (per day) yet, I do expect that to happen, if not over the weekend, then by next week,” Victoria state Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton told reporters in Melbourne.
S.Korea to extend ‘Phase 2’ social distancing measures as cases spread

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)The South Korean government is set to extend the current “Phase 2” social distancing for at least another week. Despite recording another triple-digit increase in daily new coronavirus cases, South Korean authorities on Friday stopped short of shifting the country up to the highest level of social distancing measures. “Phase 3 social distancing is the choice of last resort given the economic and social ripple effect,”Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun instead said.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 371 new coronavirus cases as of midnight Thursday, bringing the country’s total to 19,077, including 316 deaths. Health authorities had reimposed Phase 2 social distancing rules on August 16 in the Seoul metropolitan area, expanding the measures nationwide last week.
Britain backs COVID-19 immunity studies with 8.4 million pounds

(Source: Getty Images/Representational)Britain on Friday said it will back three nationwide COVID-19 studies with 8.4 million pounds to fund research into understanding human immune responses to the coronavirus pandemic. These studies are set to help scientists develop better immunity tests, study the body’s immune response tothe virus and understand why it impacts different people in different degrees.
“Together, it is hoped these studies will improve the treatment of patients and inform the development of vaccines and therapies,” the funding bodies said in a joint statement.
“Importantly, these studies will determine when and how immunity persists or whether people can become re-infected (with COVID-19),” the statement added.

A study of COVID-19 patients admitted to 138 hospitals in Britain found that less than 1 per cent were children, and of those fewer than 1 per cent — or six in total — died. These children were suffering serious illness or underlying health conditions.
“We can be quite sure that COVID-19 in itself is not causing harm to children on a significant scale,” one of the researchers said.

1035990,0,0,Trump takes campaign to New Hampshire after convention speech at White House,Japanese PM Shinzo Abe steps down cites chronic illness as reason,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fresh from accepting the Republican nomination with a sweeping attack on Democratic rival Joe Biden, President Donald Trump travels to New Hampshire on Friday to bring his re-election argument to a state he hopes to flip to his column in November. 
His Republican Party’s slimmed-down, four-day convention ended on Thursday night with a fireworks display over Washington’s National Mall and a searing speech by Trump criticizing Biden and outlining an agenda for four more years in office. 
“At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,” Trump told a crowd on the White House South Lawn. 
“This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny,” Trump said. 
Biden fired back on Twitter: “When Donald Trump says tonight you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump’s America?” 
The president has emphasized “law and order” as a key campaign theme amid protests over racial injustice around the country, while also suggesting falsely that his policies have been more helpful to Black Americans than any president since Abraham Lincoln. 
On Friday he issued a full pardon to Alice Johnson, a Black woman who received a life sentence for a first-time drug offense and whose cause was taken up by the celebrity Kim Kardashian West. Johnson addressed the Republican convention on Thursday night about Trump’s earlier commutation of her sentence. 
Trump will revisit those themes in New Hampshire, which he lost narrowly to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. He is trailing Biden, the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president, in opinion polls in the state and nationwide ahead of the Nov. 3 election. 
The president, who has criticized Biden for campaigning mostly from his Delaware home because of the coronavirus pandemic, intends to travel extensively in the coming months to boost momentum for his re-election bid. 
Trump, to his chagrin, has not been holding his signature large rallies for most of the virus outbreak. A June rally at an indoor arena in Tulsa, Oklahoma, fizzled thanks to a crowd that was well below capacity. The area experienced an uptick in coronavirus cases weeks after the event. 
Trump had vowed to return to New Hampshire after he canceled a rally planned there in July over concerns about a tropical storm off the East Coast. 
His speech on Friday, scheduled for 6 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT), will be held in a hangar in Manchester, and participants will be required to wear masks, the campaign said. 
BIDEN CAMPAIGN TRAVEL 
Biden expects his in-person campaign travel to pick up after Labor Day on Sept. 7, telling lawyers at an online fundraising event on Thursday he was considering traveling to battleground states including Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Arizona. 
“We’re going to get out and meet people where it matters, not at irresponsible rallies or staged for TV to boost egos, but real people’s communities, in real local businesses, in their lives,” Biden said. “I’m going to keep everyone safe.” 
Trump and his allies spent their convention arguing that he would restore “law and order” to the country following protests over racial injustice and would revive an economy that has been ravaged by the coronavirus outbreak. 
Some 21.6 million Americans watched Trump’s keynote speech at the convention on Thursday night, according to preliminary ratings data on Friday that suggested a lower TV audience for Trump than Biden. Trump, a former reality television star, cares deeply about ratings. 
Democrats this week continued blasting the president for his handling of the pandemic. 
Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris said during a speech on Thursday in Washington that the reality of the struggles America was facing during the pandemic were “completely absent” from the Republican convention. She vowed that a Biden-Harris administration would establish a national plan to tackle the health and economic crises, something Democrats say Trump has failed to do. 
Reporting by Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Michael Martina; Editing by Colleen Jenkins, Peter Cooney and Jonathan Oatis","Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan’s longest-serving premier, announced his resignation because of poor health on Friday, ending a stint at the helm of the world’s third-biggest economy in which he sought to revive growth and bolster its defences.
“I have decided that I will step down as prime minister, with the belief that I cannot continue being prime minister if I do not have the confidence that I can carry out the job entrusted to me by the people,” Abe, 65, told a news conference.
He said he had decided to step down now to avoid a political vacuum as the country copes with its novel coronavirus outbreak.
“I apologize from the bottom of my heart that despite all of the support from the Japanese people, I am leaving the post with one full year left in my term and in the midst of various policies and coronavirus,” Abe said. He similarly quit in 2007 after one year as premier, citing illness.
It was the second time Abe has resigned as prime minister because of poor health.
He has battled the disease ulcerative colitis for years and two recent hospital visits within a week had fanned questions on whether he could stay in the job until the end of his term as ruling party leader, and hence, premier, in September 2021.
As news of the resignation spread, Japan's benchmark Nikkei average .N225 fell 2.12% to 22,717.02, while the broader Topix .TOPX shed 1.00% to 1,599.70. The selling wiped $47 billion off Tokyo's $5.7 trillion stock market value, which had more than doubled during Abe's tenure.
The resignation will trigger a leadership race in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) - most likely in two or three weeks - and the winner must be formally elected in parliament. The new party leader will hold the post for the rest of Abe’s term.
Former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba and former foreign minister Fumio Kishida both quickly expressed interest in the top job, media reported. Among others whose names have been floated is Abe’s close aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.
Whoever wins the party poll is likely to keep Abe’s reflationary “Abenomics” policies as Japan struggles with the impact of the novel coronavirus, but may have trouble emulating the political longevity that may be Abe’s biggest legacy.
“The broad picture remains in tact. In terms of economic and fiscal policy, the focus remains very much on reflation,” said Jesper Koll, senior adviser to asset manager WisdomTree Investments.
“Longevity will be a struggle.”
On Monday, Abe surpassed a record for longest consecutive tenure as premier set by his great-uncle Eisaku Sato half a century ago.
“As head of the ruling party he worked hard on Abenomics for eight years,” said Naohito Kojima, 55, a brokerage employee.
“There were various problems but if someone else had been leader, it’s questionable whether they could have maintained a stable government as long as Mr Abe. He did various diplomatic negotiations and I think the pros outweighed the cons.”
Abe’s resignation also comes amid an uncertain geopolitical environment, including an intensifying confrontation between the United States and China and ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.
Falling Support
The conservative Abe returned as prime minister for a rare second term in December 2012, pledging to revive growth with his “Abenomics” mix of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and reforms. He also pledged to beef up Japan’s defences and aimed to revise the pacifist constitution.
Under fire for his handling of the coronavirus and scandals among party members, Abe has recently seen his support fall to one of the lowest levels of his nearly eight years in office.
Japan has not suffered the explosive surge in virus cases seen elsewhere but Abe had drawn fire for a clumsy early response and what critics see as a lack of leadership as infections spread.
In the second quarter, Japan was hit by its biggest economic slump on record as the pandemic emptied shopping malls and crushed demand for cars and other exports, bolstering the case for bolder policy action to avert a deeper recession.
Abe kept his promises to strengthen defences, boosting spending on the military after years of declines and expanding its capacity to project power abroad.
In a historic shift in 2014, his government re-interpreted the constitution to allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two.
A year later, Japan adopted laws scrapping a ban on exercising the right of collective self-defence or defending a friendly country under attack.
But Abe proved unable to revise the U.S.-drafted, post-war constitution’s pacifist Article 9, a personal mission that also eluded his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who quit as premier in 1960 because of uproar over a U.S-Japan security pact.
Abe resigned from his first stint as prime minister in 2007, citing ill-health after a year plagued by scandals in his cabinet and a huge election loss for his ruling party. He had since kept his illness in check with medicine that was not previously available.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-idUSKBN25O1AE,https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/japanese-pm-shinzo-abe-steps-down-cites-chronic-illness-as-reason-120082800939_1.html
5548605,0,0,India can be business hub to achieve Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring clean energy: UN chief,TikTok booms in Southeast Asia as it picks path through political minefields,"United Nations: India can be the business hub to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring affordable and clean energy for all, UN chief Antonio Guterres said on Friday, expressing confidence that the Indian government's decision to raise its target of renewable energy capacity will attract more international investors.
The Secretary-General underlined that like all countries, India is at a crossroad and yet despite the significant challenges the country faces in bringing shared prosperity to its population, it has in many ways embraced clean technology and a sustainable energy future.
India can be the business hub to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 7, Guterres said as he virtually delivered the 19th Darbari Seth Memorial Lecture organised by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) on Friday.
Minister for External Affairs S Jaishankar delivered the Presidential address.
SDG 7 entails ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.
The advantages of India's renewable energy resources are plain to see. They are low cost, protected from volatile commodities markets, and offer three times the job potential of fossil fuel power plants, Guterres said, adding that they can improve air quality at a time when the world's cities are literally choking.
Guterres applauded India's decision to take forward the International Solar Alliance in the form of One Sun, One World, One Grid.
""And I commend India's plans for a World Solar Bank that will mobilise USD 1 trillion of investments in solar projects over the coming decade, Guterres said at the memorial lecture organised in New Delhi.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called for connecting solar energy supply across borders giving the mantra of 'One World One Sun One Grid'.
Under the One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG) programme, India envisages to have an inter-connected power transmission grid across nations for the supply of clean energy.
The vision behind the OSOWOG mantra is 'The Sun Never Sets' and is a constant at some geographical location, globally, at any given point of time.
Guterres described India's 37 gigawatts of installed solar electricity as only the beginning, saying he is inspired by the Indian government's decision to raise its target of renewable energy capacity from the initial 2015 goal of 175 gigawatts to 500 gigawatts by 2030.
I have no doubt this decision will attract more and more international investors, such as the sovereign wealth funds and pension funds like the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec or the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, he said.
Guterres described India as a pioneer in driving innovation for access to electricity and on clean cooking and called on the country and all its innovators, entrepreneurs and business leaders to spearhead the global search for a solution to solar cooking at the household level.
Recalling the launch of the Leadership Group for Industry Transition by India and Sweden at the Climate Action Summit last year, Guterres said this partnership of key public and private sector stakeholders is committed to achieving net zero emissions by mid-century in sectors that collectively account for 30 per cent of global emissions.
Lauding companies such as Dalmia Cement and Mahindra for driving innovation, he added that there is a need for many more to join them.
Guterres also highlighted that India, with its vast size and ecological diversity, is already experiencing many of the worst impacts of climate change.
Referring to the recent floods in the country, he said the natural disaster has upended the lives of millions of people.
Climate change hits the most vulnerable hardest, undermining the remarkable progress of economies like India in bringing millions out of poverty, he said.
Guterres pointed out that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on the 1.5-degree goal of the Paris Agreement reveals that if this temperature limit is breached, India will face the brunt of the climate crisis.
The country will endure more intense heatwaves, floods and droughts, increased water stress and reduced food production, all undermining progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, Guterres said underscoring that the challenge is urgent and clear.
In order to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees, global emissions need to be halved by 2030 and the world will need to be carbon neutral before 2050.
Asserting that these goals are still achievable, Guterres underscored that as governments mobilise trillions of dollars to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, their decisions will have climate consequences for decades.
""These choices can either propel climate action forward, or set us back years, which science says we cannot afford, he said.
The UN chief urged governments to take six climate-positive actions to recover better from the pandemic - invest in green jobs, do not bail out polluting industries, end fossil-fuel subsidies, take climate risks into account in all financial and policy decisions, work together and most importantly ensuring that no one is left behind.","At 19, Sandy Saputra is big on TikTok Indonesia. Within a year, he's leapt from quiet, small-town life to star influencer status as more than 10.5 million followers lap up his toothy grin in dancing, pranking and lip-synching videos on the booming app.
Sandy's success, becoming his family's main breadwinner as global brands like Coca Cola or Suntory pay to have their names on his light-hearted clips, comes as TikTok mushrooms across Southeast Asia. Data trackers show it's been downloaded hundreds of millions of times already in a region with a collective population of 630 million - half of them under 30.
But it also comes as concerns over how secure user data is in the hands of its Chinese owner ByteDance summon big storm clouds elsewhere - TikTok has been banned in India and President Donald Trump has ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations, triggering the resignation on Thursday of only recently installed CEO Kevin Mayer.
Southeast Asia offers a clear view of the global strategy ByteDance is implementing to avoid crackdowns in other regions that influencers like Saputra now fear. The approach is to launch 'non-political' products fast, promising to governments in places like Vietnam that content will be tightly policed in accordance with local laws, according to interviews with a dozen current and former employees.
The region is now key to the future of TikTok and ByteDance: The Chinese firm is already plugging TikTok as part of a suite of interconnected apps for live video streaming, messaging and music, tackling U.S. behemoths Facebook and Google head on as both pour billions into Southeast Asia.
ByteDance declined to comment for this article, and it's unclear whether or how the prospective sale of operations in the United States and elsewhere might effect Southeast Asia. But in his base in Sukabumi, West Java province, Saputra is only too aware of risks.
""Of course I do think about it ... It would be so disappointing if TikTok was erased from Indonesia,"" Saputra told Reuters, speaking before filming a sketch https://www.tiktok.com/@sandys.ss in a paddy field.
""It wasn't planned out. I was an ordinary person, making videos like any other normal person, who didn't have an idea on how this would play out,"" said Saputra, now adding hundreds of thousands of TikTok followers every week.
SISTERAPPS
In the meantime, TikTok is ploughing ahead testing 'creator' marketplaces across the region, championing influencers like Saputra, and negotiating data deals with telecoms firms to keep a lid on consumers' smartphone bills, according to interviews with current and former staffers.
It's chasing small to medium-sized businesses as advertisers - nearly nine out of every 10 firms in Southeast Asia are classified as small - complete with how-to-advertise seminars, millions of dollars in advertising credits, and a self-service platform for businesses to make their own ads.
TikTok is piloting live-streaming commercial initiatives pioneered in China, Southeast Asia business marketing head Chew Wee Ng said in an interview with Reuters. Meanwhile ByteDance is heavily promoting sister apps like Singapore-headquartered business messaging service Lark and music streaming service Resso.
""TikTok is really unique in that people expect to see advertisers and they want to co-create with brands,"" said Ng, a former Google executive based in Singapore.
According to data from app analytics firm Sensor Tower, TikTok has had more than 360 millions downloads in Southeast Asia, nearly half of them in Indonesia, with 151% growth year-on-year for 2020.
An internal ByteDance 2019 presentation reviewed by Reuters showed that last year TikTok had 43.5 million monthly active users in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, with the majority female, the biggest online consumers in the region.
The app grew staggeringly fast in recent months, sources said, as lockdowns enforced across the region to tackle the coronavirus pandemic forced people to stay home. In Indonesia, Saputra said he's been acquiring 100,000 followers every three days.
LOCAL MODERATORS
With growth has come increased government scrutiny, but ByteDance has already had plenty of experience dealing with that. As on other business matters, ByteDance declined to comment on its handling of scrutiny.
Indonesia presented one of its first major global policy challenges in 2018, after authorities briefly banned TikTok for posts they said contained ""pornography, inappropriate content and blasphemy"".
Within 24 hours, the firm had dispatched senior executives to negotiate with Indonesia, promising to raise the age of its users and to hire a team of local moderators, according to sources and to the-then Indonesian communications minister.
It would quickly copy this approach by installing moderators across its Southeast Asian markets in a bid to insure compliance with local laws.
Reuters reported in August that from 2018 until 2020, ByteDance censored content that it perceived as critical of the Chinese government on a news aggregator app in Indonesia known as BaBe at the behest of ByteDance's China headquarters.
As of August 2020, most of the content guidelines have been localised for individual Southeast Asian countries. That has often meant strict censorship of local political content.
In Thailand, where a youth protest movement is challenging the country's monarchy, some users told Reuters their pro-protest videos had been taken down.
'IN VIETNAM, CHINA IS POLITICAL'
In Vietnam, TikTok has blocked most political content for years, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company declined to comment.
Hanoi has been in a long-running conflict with U.S. tech giants over demands to restrict any content deemed against the state and create local offices in Vietnam.
Reuters reported in April that Facebook agreed to increase censorship of ""anti-state"" posts in Vietnam after its local servers were temporarily taken off-line.
ByteDance, which unlike big U.S. tech players does have an office in the country, decided to pre-empt issues with the government by promising to make its app 'non-political'.
Due to Vietnam's contentious relationship with China, ByteDance decided it would also ban content critical of Beijing, and anything related to tensions between the two governments.
""In Vietnam, China is political,"" one source said.
The approach has been effective. TikTok now counts Vietnam, a multi-billion dollar market for social media firms, as among its most profitable in Asia, according to sources with knowledge of the matter, while launching regular campaigns with authorities on safety and tourism.
Back in West Java, Sandy Saputra aims to keep on flashing grins and goofing around on TikTok.
""To me, this isn't a job,"" he said, before breaking away into another dance routine. ""It's a hobby that makes money.""",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-can-be-business-hub-to-achieve-sustainable-development-goal-of-ensuring-clean-energy-un-chief/articleshow/77800881.cms,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/tiktok-booms-in-southeast-asia-as-it-picks-path-through-political-minefields-5765851.html
814225,0,0,Exclusive: Most U.S. states reject Trump administration's new COVID-19 testing guidance - Reuters,Japanese PM Abe resigns over worsening health,"(Reuters) - A majority of U.S. states have rejected new Trump administration COVID-19 testing guidance in an extraordinary rebuke of the nation’s top agency for disease prevention, according to officials at state health agencies and public statements reviewed by Reuters. 
At least 33 states continue to recommend testing people who have been exposed to COVID-19 and have no symptoms, spurning guidance published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week that said testing may be unnecessary. Sixteen states did not immediately respond to requests for comment and North Dakota said it had not made a decision. 
Among the states breaking with the federal government are conservative-leaning Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona. 
Public health experts said a rupture of this magnitude with the CDC may be unprecedented and shows deepening distrust of the Trump administration and its response to the pandemic. 
“This is states almost all-out rebelling against the new guidelines,” said Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 
The CDC said on Monday that people exposed to COVID-19 but not symptomatic “do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health care provider or State or local public health officials recommend you take one.” 
The CDC had previously recommended testing of all people who had close contact with someone who was diagnosed with COVID-19. That remains the policy of at least 30 states. Some that have not changed policy said they were studying the CDC guidance. 
(GRAPHIC: Majority of U.S. states rebuff CDC's new COVID-19 testing guidance - here) 
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the CDC, said the new guidance does not discourage asymptomatic individuals from being tested. 
She said that public officials who are breaking with the administration “have incorrectly interpreted the guidance. The CDC guidance states ‘the decision to be tested should be one made in collaboration with public health officials or your health care provider based on individual circumstances and the status of community spread.’” 
Some state leaders and public health experts accuse the administration of using politics rather than science to guide its response to the pandemic. 
“This 180-degree reversal of COVID-19 testing guidelines is reckless, and not based on science and has the potential to do long-term damage to the (CDC’s) reputation,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and the governors of New Jersey and Connecticut said in a statement, rejecting the new CDC guidance. 
Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at HHS, said there was no political pressure from the administration. He said testing asymptomatic patients too early could produce false negatives and contribute to the virus’s spread. 
“It’s pointless to be tested for the five to seven days (after infection) because you’re not going to be positive,” said David Battinelli, chief medical officer at Northwell Health, acknowledging concerns over testing too early. “There is an enormous amount of unnecessary testing going on.” 
Idaho recommends that people exposed to COVID-19 contact their doctor to determine if they need testing. It was among the states that did not respond to a request for comment on the CDC guidance. 
Public health officials believe the United States needs to test more frequently, that it is crucial to find asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers to slow the spread, and that the CDC’s comments could risk discouraging necessary testing. 
Even before the CDC guidance, the number of coronavirus tests being conducted was on a decline. The United States tested on average 675,000 people a day last week, down from a peak of more than 800,000 people a day in late July. 
Nationally, cases have fallen for five weeks in a row but infections are surging again in the U.S. Midwest with four states reporting record one-day increases in cases on Thursday as the U.S. death toll climbed above 180,000. 
Reporting by Carl O'Donnell, Vishwadha Chander and Manojna Maddipatla; Editing by Peter Henderson and Daniel Wallis","Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan’s longest-serving premier, said on Friday he was resigning because of poor health, ending a stint at the helm of the world’s third-biggest economy during which he sought to revive growth and bolster its defences.
“I cannot be prime minister if I cannot make the best decisions for the people. I have decided to step down from my post,” Abe, 65, told a news conference.
Abe has battled the disease ulcerative colitis for years and two recent hospital visits within a week had fanned questions on whether he could stay in the job until the end of his term as ruling party leader, and hence, premier, in September 2021.
As news of the resignation spread, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei average fell 2.12% to 22,717.02, while the broader Topix shed 1.00% to 1,599.70. The selling wiped $4.7 billion off Tokyo’s $5.7 trillion stock market value, which had more than doubled during Abe’s tenure.
The resignation will trigger a leadership race in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) - most likely in two or three weeks - and the winner must be formally elected in parliament. The new party leader will hold the post for the rest of Abe’s term.
Whoever wins the party poll is likely to keep Abe’s reflationary “Abenomics” policies as Japan struggles with the impact of the novel coronavirus, but may have trouble emulating the political longevity that may be Abe’s biggest legacy.
“The broad picture remains in tact. In terms of economic and fiscal policy, the focus remains very much on reflation,” said Jesper Koll, senior adviser to asset manager WisdomTree Investments.
“Longevity will be a struggle.”
On Monday, Abe surpassed a record for longest consecutive tenure as premier set by his great-uncle Eisaku Sato half a century ago.

“As head of the ruling party he worked hard on Abenomics for eight years,” said brokerage employee Naohito Kojima, 55.
“There were various problems but if someone else had been leader, it’s questionable whether they could have maintained a stable government as long as Mr Abe. He did various diplomatic negotiations and I think the pros outweighed the cons.”
Abe’s resignation also comes amid an uncertain geopolitical environment, including an intensifying confrontation between the United States and China and ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.
FALLING SUPPORT
The conservative Abe returned as prime minister for a rare second term in December 2012, pledging to revive growth with his “Abenomics” mix of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and reforms. He also pledged to beef up Japan’s defences and aimed to revise the pacifist constitution.
Under fire for his handling of the coronavirus and scandals among party members, Abe has recently seen his support fall to one of the lowest levels of his nearly eight years in office.
Japan has not suffered the explosive surge in virus cases seen elsewhere, but Abe had drawn fire for a clumsy early response and what critics see as a lack of leadership as infections spread.
In the second quarter, Japan was hit by its biggest economic slump on record as the pandemic emptied shopping malls and crushed demand for cars and other exports, bolstering the case for bolder policy action to avert a deeper recession.
Abe kept his promises to strengthen defences, boosting spending on the military after years of declines and expanding its capacity to project power abroad.
In a historic shift in 2014, his government re-interpreted the constitution to allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two.
A year later, Japan adopted laws scrapping a ban on exercising the right of collective self-defence or defending a friendly country under attack.
But Abe proved unable to revise the U.S.-drafted, post-war constitution’s pacifist Article 9, a personal mission that also eluded his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who quit as premier in 1960 because of uproar over a U.S-Japan security pact.
Abe resigned from his first stint as prime minister in 2007, citing ill-health after a year plagued by scandals in his cabinet and a huge election loss for his ruling party. He had since kept his illness in check with medicine that was not previously available.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-testing-exclusive-idUSKBN25O2WI,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shinzo-abe-resigns-as-japan-s-prime-minister/story-FjY1dpvamrujzjaO5cPHSK.html
289264,0,0,"Explained: Why New Delhi will miss Abe, who gave new shape to Japan’s India ties","Theatrics aside, Kamala Harris will help build on Donald Trump’s India policy - Livemint","Abes leadership has transformed Japans relationship with India. (Express photo: Renuka Puri)Japans Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Friday that he would step down as a chronic illness has resurfaced. Abe, 65, was due to be in office till September 2021. He will stay on until his party chooses a successor, and will remain an MP.
Abes leadership has transformed Japans relationship with India.
Abes lineage
Abe comes from a political family. His grandfather Nobusuke Kishi was PM (1957-60), then his father Shintaro Abe was Foreign Minister (1982-86). On Monday, Abe became Japans longest-serving PM by consecutive days in office, overtaking the record of Eisaku Sato, his great-uncle, who served 2,798 days during 1964-72. Abe had first become the countrys PM in 2006, but resigned in 2007 due to illness. His current stint began in 2012.
Abe in India
In his first stint in 2006-07, Abe visited India and addressed Parliament. During his second stint, he visited India thrice (January 2014, December 2015, September 2017) the most visits by any Japanese PM.
He was the first Japanese PM to be Chief Guest at the Republic Day parade in 2014. This reflected his commitment towards an India relationship he was being hosted by a government that would be facing elections in May 2014. As Japans leader, he was wooed both by the UPA under Dr Manmohan Singh and the NDA under Narendra Modi.
Transformation in ties
While the foundation for Global Partnership between Japan and India was laid in 2001, and annual bilateral summits were agreed in 2005, Abe accelerated the pace of ties since 2012.
In August 2007, when Abe visited India for the first time as PM, he delivered the now-famous Confluence of the Two Seas speech laying the foundation for his concept of Indo-Pacific. This concept has now become mainstream and one of the main pillars of India-Japan ties.
During his second term, Abe helped build the relationship further.
Having visited Japan several times as Gujarat CM, Modi as PM chose Japan for his first bilateral visit outside the neighbourhood, in September 2014. Modi and Abe agreed to upgrade the bilateral relationship to Special Strategic and Global Partnership. The relationship grew and encompassed issues from civilian nuclear energy to maritime security, bullet trains to quality infrastructure, Act East policy to Indo-Pacific strategy.
On Friday, after Abe announced his decision to step down, Modi tweeted: Pained to hear about your ill health, my dear friend @AbeShinzo. In recent years, with your wise leadership and personal commitment, the India-Japan partnership has become deeper and stronger than ever before. I wish and pray for your speedy recovery.
When Modi went to Japan in 2014, the Indo-Japan nuclear deal was still uncertain, with Tokyo sensitive about a pact with a non-Nuclear-Proliferation-Treaty member country. Abes government convinced the anti-nuclear hawks in Japan to sign the agreement in 2016. The pact was key to Indias deals with US and French nuclear firms, which were either owned by or had stakes in Japanese firms.
Defence and Indo-Pacific
While the security agreement was in place since 2008, under Abe the two sides decided to have Foreign and Defence Ministers Meeting (2+2), and are negotiating the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement a kind of military logistics support pact. In November 2019, the first Foreign and Defence Ministers Meeting was held in New Delhi. A pact for transfer of defence equipment and technology was also signed in 2015, an uncommon agreement for post-War Japan.
During Abes tenure, India and Japan came closer in the Indo-Pacific architecture. Abe had spelt out his vision of the Confluence of the Two Seas in his 2007 speech when the Quad was formed. It collapsed soon, but in October 2017, as Chinese aggression grew in the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Indias borders in Doklam, it was Abes Japan that really mooted the idea of reviving the Quad. In November 2017, it was revived as Indian, Japanese, Australia and US officials met in Manila on the sidelines of the East Asia summit.
India-China stand-offs
Since 2013, Indian and Chinese soldiers have had four publicly known border-stand-offs April 2013, September 2014, June-August 2017, and the ongoing one since May 2020. Abes Japan has stood with India through each of them. During the Doklam crisis and the current stand-off, Japan has made statements against China for changing the status quo.
Infrastructure
During Abes visit in 2015, India decided to introduce the Shinkansen system (bullet train), due to begin in 2022. Under Abes leadership, India and Japan also formed the Act East Forum and are engaged in projects in the Northeast, closely watched by China. The two countries also planned joint projects in Maldives and Sri Lanka among others to counter Beijings influence.
What next
Abe has been a valuable G-7 leader for India, focused on strategic, economic and political deliverables, and not getting distracted by Indias domestic developments much to New Delhis comfort.
Having hosted Modi at his ancestral home in Yamanashi, the first such reception extended to a foreign leader, Abe was feted at a roadshow in Ahmedabad. His planned visit to India last December in Guwahati, however, was cancelled due to the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.
New Delhi will now wait for Abes successor who, as a South Block official said, will have big shoes to fill.

Her family is confident that Harris, the first Black and Indian-American woman on a major presidential party ticket, will win over the rest of a country that has moved closer to the U.S. thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modis close ties with Donald Trump.
Indians love drama, which explains President Trumps popularity in India,"" said Harriss maternal uncle, Gopalan Balachandran, an academic based in New Delhi. But I am confident that she will be equally popular.""
Forged by theatrics, the Trump-Modi bond culminated in two giant stadium events in front of tens of thousands of their supporters -- one in Houston last September and the other in Modis home state of Gujarat in February. And while the warming relations have not yet resolved a trade spat, India has expanded arms purchases from the U.S. and aligned with it more openly against China.
The Trump administration has made India a key part of its Free and Open Indo-Pacific"" strategy, and backed Modis government following deadly clashes between Chinese and Indian troops along their disputed Himalayan border in June. India is also a key part of the informal regional grouping to counter China known as the Quad, which also includes the U.S., Japan and Australia.
Still, the closer ties between the U.S. and India are likely to persist in a Biden-Harris White House, said Amitabh Mattoo, a former member of Indias National Security Council Advisory Board.
They may not roll out a red carpet or give bear hugs or talk about each other in narcissistic terms, but I dont think there will be substantial shift in the importance that Washington has for India -- that will remain,"" said Mattoo, the author of more than a dozen books on international relations and a professor at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University. Biden is unlikely to do anything reckless in terms of changing posture as long as the China threat remains.""
A spokesman for the Biden-Harris campaign referred to Bidens plan to place a high priority on continuing to strengthen the U.S.-India relationship."" The campaign declined to comment further.
Frayed Nerves
India-U.S. ties have advanced under previous Democratic administrations. In March 2000, President Bill Clinton looked past Indias nuclear tests to begin developing a stronger bilateral relationship. Under the George W. Bush administration, Biden helped pilot the civil nuclear cooperation with India in the Senate as chair of the foreign relations committee.
And though relations soured after the arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York in 2013, Barack Obama mended ties soon after Modis election. The leaders sat for hours together in the rain as Obama become the first U.S. president to be the official chief guest"" at Indias Republic Day parade.
Trump has hit India on trade while avoiding more controversial issues. While in New Delhi in February, Trump said hed raised the issue of religious freedom with Modi, but declined to comment on demonstrations against the governments new citizenship law discriminating against Muslims. Hes also offered to mediate"" between India and its rival Pakistan on Kashmir after Modi ended decades of autonomy in Indias only Muslim-majority state.
Harris has expressed more concern about Modis actions, which has led to a lengthy crackdown in Kashmir and nationwide street protests earlier in the year over the citizenship law.
We have to remind Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world,"" Harris said in September 2019 while on the campaign trail. We are keeping track of the situation. There is a need to intervene if the situation demands."" A Biden campaign policy paper outlining his outreach toward Muslim Americans criticized India over Kashmir and the citizenship law, while in a statement released earlier this month he said he would stand by India in confronting the threats it faces along its borders.
Strategic Relations
Despite those issues, Modis ruling Bharatiya Janata Party said the U.S. and India have deep strategic relations"" supported widely across party lines in both countries.
As far as the BJP is concerned, we are naturally happy that someone with Indian ancestry is contesting the second topmost post in USA,"" Vijay Chauthaiwale, chief of foreign affairs in the party who helped organize the Namaste Trump event in Gujarat in February, said in a text message.
Bidens campaign has pledged reform the H-1B visa system and work to eliminate the country-quota for green cards, both issues that are important to the increasingly influential Indian American community. And observers expect him to go easier on trade issues than Trump.
While Harris Indian heritage will no doubt be a positive element in her approach to India, the more important bit is that the administration will not be as publicly harsh on trade and visas,"" said Arun K Singh, a former Indian ambassador to the U.S.
Indians form about a fifth of 20 million Asian Americans and are often more educated and earn more than other immigrant groups, the Washington-based Pew Research Center found. About 65% of Indian Americans were Democrats or leaned toward the Democrats, according to a 2014 Pew Research paper.
Politics was a frequent topic of discussion in the Harris family home in India, said Sarala Gopalan, Kamalas aunt, who said the vice presidential candidate is very close to her relatives. Gopalan, one of the Chitthis Harris referred to in her acceptance speech, said the village offered prayers at a local temple when her candidacy was announced.
My father was working for the government, my mother was very much interested in politics,"" Gopalan, 76, said. She had politics in her blood.""

1036482,0,0,Trump takes campaign to New Hampshire after convention speech at White House,"Hurricane Laura: Six killed in ‘Category 4’ hurricane; Trump to survey damage in Louisiana, Texas","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fresh from accepting the Republican nomination with a sweeping attack on Democratic rival Joe Biden, President Donald Trump travels to New Hampshire on Friday to bring his re-election argument to a state he hopes to flip to his column in November. 
His Republican Party’s slimmed-down, four-day convention ended on Thursday night with a fireworks display over Washington’s National Mall and a searing speech by Trump criticizing Biden and outlining an agenda for four more years in office. 
“At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,” Trump told a crowd on the White House South Lawn. 
“This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny,” Trump said. 
Biden fired back on Twitter: “When Donald Trump says tonight you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump’s America?” 
The president has emphasized “law and order” as a key campaign theme amid protests over racial injustice around the country, while also suggesting falsely that his policies have been more helpful to Black Americans than any president since Abraham Lincoln. 
On Friday he issued a full pardon to Alice Johnson, a Black woman who received a life sentence for a first-time drug offense and whose cause was taken up by the celebrity Kim Kardashian West. Johnson addressed the Republican convention on Thursday night about Trump’s earlier commutation of her sentence. 
Trump will revisit those themes in New Hampshire, which he lost narrowly to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. He is trailing Biden, the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president, in opinion polls in the state and nationwide ahead of the Nov. 3 election. 
The president, who has criticized Biden for campaigning mostly from his Delaware home because of the coronavirus pandemic, intends to travel extensively in the coming months to boost momentum for his re-election bid. 
Trump, to his chagrin, has not been holding his signature large rallies for most of the virus outbreak. A June rally at an indoor arena in Tulsa, Oklahoma, fizzled thanks to a crowd that was well below capacity. The area experienced an uptick in coronavirus cases weeks after the event. 
Trump had vowed to return to New Hampshire after he canceled a rally planned there in July over concerns about a tropical storm off the East Coast. 
His speech on Friday, scheduled for 6 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT), will be held in a hangar in Manchester, and participants will be required to wear masks, the campaign said. 
BIDEN CAMPAIGN TRAVEL 
Biden expects his in-person campaign travel to pick up after Labor Day on Sept. 7, telling lawyers at an online fundraising event on Thursday he was considering traveling to battleground states including Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Arizona. 
“We’re going to get out and meet people where it matters, not at irresponsible rallies or staged for TV to boost egos, but real people’s communities, in real local businesses, in their lives,” Biden said. “I’m going to keep everyone safe.” 
Trump and his allies spent their convention arguing that he would restore “law and order” to the country following protests over racial injustice and would revive an economy that has been ravaged by the coronavirus outbreak. 
Some 21.6 million Americans watched Trump’s keynote speech at the convention on Thursday night, according to preliminary ratings data on Friday that suggested a lower TV audience for Trump than Biden. Trump, a former reality television star, cares deeply about ratings. 
Democrats this week continued blasting the president for his handling of the pandemic. 
Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris said during a speech on Thursday in Washington that the reality of the struggles America was facing during the pandemic were “completely absent” from the Republican convention. She vowed that a Biden-Harris administration would establish a national plan to tackle the health and economic crises, something Democrats say Trump has failed to do.

(Bill Feig/The Advocate via AP, Pool)A day after Hurricane Laura swept ashore and ripped through Louisiana, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake, the catastrophic category 4 storm weakened into a tropical depression on Friday. So far, the hurricane one of the most powerful storms in US history has claimed at least six lives and has left homes and buildings in ruins, CNN reported. 
According to the US states Health Department, the death toll from the hurricane includes a 14-year-old girl and a 68-year-old man, who were crushed under fallen trees. All six victims were from different parts of Louisiana including Calcasieu, Acadia, Allen, Jackson and Vernon Parishes, a department spokesperson told CNN. 
Areas along the Louisiana-Texas border bore the brunt of the storm after it made landfall near a small town in Louisiana, called Cameron, early on Thursday morning. The city of Lake Charles, which has an estimated population of around 78,000 people, was one of the worst-hit by the hurricane. 
Sustained winds of upto 150 mph, accompanied with lashing rain battered the streets of Lake Charles overnight uprooting electric poles and trees, and tearing off the roofs of homes and buildings across the city. Many residents returned to their neighbourhoods once the storm had subsided, only to find rubble where their houses once stood.

According to a report by the Washington Post, the fire was triggered when an undefined amount of chlorine started to decompose during the storm, which in turn generated heat. Louisiana State Police Superintendent Kevin W. Reeves said that a small crew from BioLab first tried to extinguish the fire, before calling state authorities for support. 
First responders immediately rushed to the site to quell the flames.

President Trump to visit Texas and Louisiana to survey storm damage
During a press conference Thursday, US President Donald Trump announced that he plans to travel to Texas and Louisiana this weekend, to survey the damage caused by Hurricane Laura. Trump also said that he was planning to postpone his speech at the Republican National Convention due to the hurricane, CNN reported. 
I was actually prepared to postpone the speech tonight and make it Monday, he said during a press briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agencys national headquarters. I was going to Texas, I was going to Louisiana, maybe Arkansas.

Power outages were reported across the state in the aftermath of Hurricane Laura. More than 875,000 were left without electricity after the power lines were snapped and electric poles were uprooted due to strong winds and lashing rain, AP reported.
Meanwhile, in Lake Charles most residents did not having running water, according to a CNN report. Weve got some plants that are open, but its not enough to serve the entire city. The pressure is in the single digits, City Administrator John Cardone told CNN.
Cardone said that water spooky is expected to return to at least 45% capacity by Friday. Engineering consultants arrived in the city yesterday, to help fix the system.

The Governor said that Laura was the strongest hurricane to ever strike the state of Louisiana. A full assessment of the losses incurred by the storm will take days to prepare, AP reported.

2252483,0,0,"Peru, with world's deadliest outbreak, readies to start vaccine tests - Reuters",TikTok is said to wrestle with two competing offers,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru will start testing coronavirus vaccines from China’s Sinopharm and U.S. drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson in September, researchers said, which should help the country gain faster access to inoculations once the vaccines are approved. 
Sinopharm began this week to recruit up to 6,000 volunteers in Peru, which Reuters data indicates has the highest number of COVID-19 deaths in relation to its population size. A team of Chinese scientists is expected to arrive in the Andean nation next week to work with local researchers, said Germán Málaga, a doctor and lead vaccine investigator at Lima’s Cayetano Heredia University. 
“This is going to happen around Sept. 3, to begin vaccinations on Sept. 8,” he said. Sinopharm’s clinical trials in Peru are being done with Cayetano Heredia and the state-run Universidad Mayor de San Marcos. 
Peru has recorded around 622,000 cases of the coronavirus, the fifth highest case load in the world, and 28,277 deaths. It now has the world’s deadliest fatality rate per capita, with 86.67 deaths per 100,000 people, a Reuters tally shows, just ahead of Belgium. 
Sinopharm will also do clinical coronavirus vaccine trials elsewhere in Latin America, including in Argentina. 
Other Chinese laboratories that will be conducting trials in the region include Sinovac Biotech, which will work in Brazil and Chile, and Walvax Biotechnology Co Ltd and CanSino Biologics Inc, which will test in Mexico, authorities have said. 
Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen unit will start tests with some 4,000 volunteers in Peru around Sept. 24, Prime Minister Walter Martos told reporters on Thursday. 
“We are contacting other companies, laboratories, from Britain and other countries that are going to help us immunize at least 70% of the local population,” Martos said. 
J&amp;J said earlier this week that it would conduct Phase III trials for its vaccine in Chile, Argentina and Peru. 
Peru, a country of nearly 33 million people and the world’s no. 2 copper producer, has been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic, both in terms of infections and economic impact. The economy crumbled over 30% in the second quarter of the year. 
The death toll could also be higher than official figures suggest. A national registry shows that between April and August there were 68,192 more deaths compared to the same period in 2019. Excess deaths often give a better indication of the true number of fatalities. 
Researcher Málaga and Carlos Castillo, the chief adviser for immunizations and vaccines at Peru’s health ministry, said that carrying out clinical trials would help Peru get faster access to vaccines when they were ready. 
“There is an unwritten agreement, in the sense that in the country where a clinical trial is being carried out, it has priority access to vaccine availability,” Castillo said. 
Reporting by Marco Aquino and Reuters TV; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Rosalba O'Brien","By Mike IsaacSAN FRANCISCO: The race to buy TikToks U.S. operations has entered its final stages, with two groups submitting bids for the video app, said three people involved in the deal talks. One of the bids was from Microsoft and Walmart, which have teamed up, and the other was from Oracle and could include a coalition of investors, they said.
The discussions remain fluid, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. It is unclear which group will secure a deal, and the makeup of the bidders could still change.
But TikToks owner, Chinese internet company ByteDance, will most likely make a decision on the competing bids in the coming days, they said. And whichever bid is selected is likely to set TikToks U.S. business down very different paths.
A deal with Microsoft and Walmart could draw on Walmarts digital sales background to turn TikTok into a kind of e-commerce app for both creators and users, people involved in the talks said. That could make TikTok more like Douyin, ByteDances TikTok-like Chinese-language video app, which already has e-commerce integrated into it.
A deal with Oracle, the enterprise software company, would be more of a data play. Oracle could use TikToks data about social interactions to benefit its cloud, data and advertising businesses, the people said.
Representatives for TikTok, Microsoft and Oracle declined to comment. In a statement, Walmart confirmed it was participating in the discussions and said, We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of U.S. TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of U.S. government regulators.
Any deal would cap months of turbulence for TikTok, which has been under intense pressure from the Trump administration. White House officials, who have become increasingly tough on China, have said that TikTok poses a national security threat because it could provide data about U.S. users to Beijing. This month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order mandating that TikTok sell its U.S. operations by mid-September or cease transactions within the country.
That pushed ByteDance and TikTok to seek a buyer, in what could amount to a blockbuster deal. Microsoft had already been talking with TikTok and ByteDance about a potential acquisition, people with knowledge of the talks have said. They initially discussed Microsoft taking just a minority stake in TikTok, before the scope of a deal ballooned.
Since then, Oracle and other bidders have also joined the talks. Bankers and others have also called Netflix, Twitter and others to gauge their interest in doing a deal with TikTok, though the degree of interest has varied widely.
Under stipulations set by the White House to alleviate national security concerns, ByteDance would need to sell TikToks U.S. operations to reduce the apps Chinese ownership. It would also have to sell to one or more companies that have a technology services provider, in part to transfer TikToks American user data over to U.S. servers. Both Microsoft and Oracle satisfy those requirements.
Prices for a potential deal have ranged from $20 billion to $50 billion, people with knowledge of the talks have said. It was unclear what bid amounts were submitted.
Microsoft, with $137 billion in cash and a market value of more than $1.7 trillion, is far larger than other potential acquirers and has the deepest resources. Oracle, with a market value of $175 billion, has roughly $43 billion in cash and short-term investments, and also holds debt.
Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors that the participation of Walmart was likely the final piece of the puzzle that ultimately cements Microsoft successfully acquiring TikToks U.S. operations for likely $35 billion to $40 billion.
The emergence of the two bids follows the resignation late Wednesday of TikToks chief executive, Kevin Mayer. Mayer, a former Disney executive who had announced he was joining TikTok in May, said he was resigning because he had signed on for a global role, not to run a carved-up version of the company. In a note to employees, he also indicated that a deal for TikTok might be close.
We expect to reach a resolution very soon, Mayer wrote.
Zhang Yiming, ByteDances chief executive, said in his own note that ByteDance and TikTok were moving swiftly to resolve its issues in the United States and India, where the app was banned in June.
I cannot get into details at this point, but I can assure you that we are developing solutions that will be in the interest of users, creators, partners and employees, Zhang said.
While Microsofts and Oracles interest in a bid for TikToks U.S. operations has been known, Walmarts participation only emerged Thursday. The worlds largest retailer, known for its brick-and-mortar stores, has recently been pushing into digital businesses like entertainment, partly as a way to outpace its rival Amazon.
The lines are blurring between traditional shopping, digital shopping and social media, said Michael Lasser, a retail analyst for UBS. Connecting with a younger audience is vital to Walmarts long-term outlook, especially as more digitally native generations move into their prime consumption years.
The pandemic has shown the importance of e-commerce to Walmart and other big-box retailers. In an earnings report this month, Walmart said its online sales doubled during the quarter.
Microsoft and Walmart have teamed up before. In 2018, the companies announced a multiyear cloud partnership aimed at accelerating Walmarts digital commerce business.
Oracle, on the other hand, has long been rivals with Microsoft. Both compete to provide software and cloud services to businesses. They have battled over similar contracts, such as the $10 billion technology contract for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, known as JEDI, with the Department of Defense. Microsoft won the contract last year.
In Washington, members of the Trump administration have expressed support for a deal with Oracle. Safra Catz, Oracles chief executive, and Lawrence Ellison, Oracles founder and executive chairman, have close relationships with Trump and other members of the White House, having cultivated those ties for years.
This month, Trump told reporters he would support a TikTok sale to Oracle, which he called a great company.
I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it, Trump said.
Whichever bidder wins the TikTok deal will face the challenges of running a user-generated content business. TikTok has made missteps around content moderation, including an incident in which it suppressed videos from queer, disabled and overweight users. And because TikTok appears to be used by a large number of underage users, any acquirer would have to deal with preventing child exploitative behavior on the platform.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-peru-vaccine-idUSKBN25O2CS,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/tiktok-is-said-to-wrestle-with-two-competing-offers/articleshow/77796914.cms
3886213,0,0,India may get coronavirus vaccine by early 2021: Bernstein report,IPL set to kick-start consumption cycle,"As COVID-19 vaccine trials move ahead at a break-neck speed, an approved vaccine is likely to hit the Indian market by the first quarter of 2021, Bernstein said in a report.
Globally, there are 4 candidates that are close to approval by the end of 2020 or early 2021.
Through partnerships, India has access to two of those AZ/Oxford's viral vector vaccine and Novavax's protein subunit vaccine.
""Phase I/II data looks promising for both in terms of safety and the vaccine's ability to elicit an immune response,"" it said. ""We are optimistic that there will be an approved vaccine in the market by 1Q calendar year 2021 in India.""
While the vaccine could be available at USD 3-6 (Rs 225 to Rs 550) per dose, herd immunity might be two years away due to implementation challenges, it said, adding the experience in large scale adult vaccination programmes is thin.
The polio eradication campaign in 2011 and the recent Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) are examples of large-scale campaigns but the scale there was 1/3rd of what the COVID-19 vaccine implementation programme demands.
Cold chain storage and trained manpower will be the biggest hurdles, it said. ""Even assuming 2x current throughput, implementation in the government programme can take 18-20 months.""
""We believe, the first set of vaccines will be allocated to the vulnerable population healthcare workers, population above 65 years followed by essential sector workers and the economically weaker section of the population,"" the brokerage said.
Detailing on vaccine trials, it said Novavax's candidate has shown higher levels of antibodies and viral neutralisation, about 5-6x HCS (Human Convalescent Sera) compared to AZ/Oxford's vaccine, which came close to average HCS levels. These, however, are not strictly comparable as the convalescent groups were different.
But, both showed enough promise to progress to Phase III and trials are underway now. It also appears that both the candidates will require 2 doses to be administered 21/28 days apart.
Stating that Serum Institute of India (SII) is best positioned to deliver the first vaccine, Bernstein said SII has partnered with both AZ/Oxford and Novavax to manufacture and commercialise their vaccines on approval.
SII has existing capabilities in both protein sub-unit (commercial) and viral vector (pipeline) technologies and their current capacities can be repurposed.
""We do not foresee manufacturing scale-up challenges,"" it said. ""They are also investing in additional capacities of 1 billion doses and we estimate will be geared up to supply 600 million doses in 2021 and one billion doses in 2022 out of which 400-500 million should be available for India in 2021 keeping in mind their other commitments.""
Beyond SII, Zydus, Bharat Biotech, and Biological E are also working on their own vaccine candidates and are currently in Phase I/II.
Bernstein said India's vaccine market can be USD 6 billion over FY21-22. ""We estimate volumes to be split 55:45 between the government channel and private market and procurement prices to be USD 3 per dose for the government and end-consumer prices of USD 6 in the private market.

IPL is a huge and unifying property as it brings cricket and entertainment together, catering to a variety of demographics. It has the potential of uplifting the mood of the consumers, owing to its scale and reach,"" said Ashish Bhasin, CEO-APAC and chairman-India at Dentsu Aegis Network.
Moreover, it would be the first time when the tournament will coincide with the festive season, which is expected to further lift consumer sentiment. IPL does have the potential to catalyze consumer sentiment and consumption.""
For broadcasters, the pent-up demand for live sports could translate into high viewership, with matches starting at a convenient 7.30pm. The official broadcaster Star Sports and its streaming platform Disney+ Hotstarthe only channels showing the matchesare confident of beating the 2019 viewership record of 424 million.
Gautam Thakar, chief executive of Star Sports, said Dream11 IPL is not just a comeback of Indias most eagerly awaited sporting event but also a symbol of hope returning to the lives of people. The anticipation for IPL is like never before, given that fans have missed watching their favourite players in action for a long time. This, combined with the early start of matches at 7.30pm, home-bound viewers and fewer doubleheaders, we are confident IPL 2020 will by far be the biggest IPL ever,"" he added.
IPL is the biggest cricket property for Star India and has fetched more than 2,000 crore in ad revenue in 2019. It is hoping to cross this revenue figure this year, despite the covid-19 disruption.
Stars asking price for the live match inventory is 12 lakh for a 10-second slot. As of March, the network had signed 12 sponsors and 80 advertisers from categories as diverse as consumer durables, e-commerce, digital payment, food delivery apps, online education and mobile gaming platforms. Star has also extended its pre-match shows from 60 to 90 minutes, allowing brands to buy cheaper ad slots.
Analysts expect quick service restaurants (QSR) to be the biggest beneficiaries, followed by soft beverages and liquor firms.
The timing (of IPL matches) is such that we will see very high viewership as these will be the first India-specific games. Globally, where other sports are happening, the viewership is high,"" said Abneesh Roy, executive vice-president (research), Edelweiss Securities.
This, he said, will also benefit organized large QSR chainsespecially those selling burgers and pizzasas IPL viewers glued to their television sets place orders.
We have seen a spike in digital/online ordering in the last few months and are confident it will continue. Consumers are looking forward to the cricketing season to battle pandemic or lockdown blues. We will add to the excitement with relevant and exciting offerings,"" said Moksh Chopra, chief marketing officer at KFC India.
It remains to be seen whether state governments will allow bars to open.
The increased viewership will also translate into revenue opportunities for television news channels. There will be a spike as brands using IPL as their communication peg amplify the messaging on surround platforms, and news is an integral part of their plans,"" said Vikas Khanchandani, CEO, Republic TV, a news channel.

4026243,0,0,KFC’s first outlet in Srinagar beats company’s sales estimates in ten days,TikTok booms in Southeast Asia as it picks path through political minefields,"NEW DELHI: Yum Restaurants-owned quick service brand KFCs first outlet in Srinagar which opened about 10 days back, has beaten the companys internal sales estimates and reported sales similar to store openings in metro cities, two officials directly aware of the development said.
The response in Srinagar has beaten internal sales estimates, one of the officials said. He requested not to be named.
KFC India's spokesperson was unreachable for comment.
KFC has over 400 outlets operational in India. Though it has two existing outlets in Jammu, this is the first one in Srinagar, and among the few global restaurant chains to have set up an outlet in the city.
The development comes at a time when dine-in businesses across restaurant chains have been severely impacted and reported steep decline in sales across the country, after the government announced a nationwide lockdown starting last week of March to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
In August last year, the Indian government abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution that grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir.
While malls and market places began reopening with restrictions in various cities starting June with lockdown curbs easing, consumers have remained wary of eating out, which has resulted in restaurant chains relying only on deliveries and to some extent on takeaways to keep sales ticking.
Earlier this year, Yum Restaurants, Indian subsidiary of Yum Brands, picked up minority stake in its largest franchise
partner RJ Corp-owned Devyani International Ltd (DIL), making it one of the first franchisees globally where the restaurant company has acquired equity stake.","At 19, Sandy Saputra is big on TikTok Indonesia. Within a year, he's leapt from quiet, small-town life to star influencer status as more than 10.5 million followers lap up his toothy grin in dancing, pranking and lip-synching videos on the booming app.
Sandy's success, becoming his family's main breadwinner as global brands like Coca Cola or Suntory pay to have their names on his light-hearted clips, comes as TikTok mushrooms across Southeast Asia. Data trackers show it's been downloaded hundreds of millions of times already in a region with a collective population of 630 million - half of them under 30.
But it also comes as concerns over how secure user data is in the hands of its Chinese owner ByteDance summon big storm clouds elsewhere - TikTok has been banned in India and President Donald Trump has ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations, triggering the resignation on Thursday of only recently installed CEO Kevin Mayer.
Southeast Asia offers a clear view of the global strategy ByteDance is implementing to avoid crackdowns in other regions that influencers like Saputra now fear. The approach is to launch 'non-political' products fast, promising to governments in places like Vietnam that content will be tightly policed in accordance with local laws, according to interviews with a dozen current and former employees.
The region is now key to the future of TikTok and ByteDance: The Chinese firm is already plugging TikTok as part of a suite of interconnected apps for live video streaming, messaging and music, tackling U.S. behemoths Facebook and Google head on as both pour billions into Southeast Asia.
ByteDance declined to comment for this article, and it's unclear whether or how the prospective sale of operations in the United States and elsewhere might effect Southeast Asia. But in his base in Sukabumi, West Java province, Saputra is only too aware of risks.
""Of course I do think about it ... It would be so disappointing if TikTok was erased from Indonesia,"" Saputra told Reuters, speaking before filming a sketch https://www.tiktok.com/@sandys.ss in a paddy field.
""It wasn't planned out. I was an ordinary person, making videos like any other normal person, who didn't have an idea on how this would play out,"" said Saputra, now adding hundreds of thousands of TikTok followers every week.
SISTERAPPS
In the meantime, TikTok is ploughing ahead testing 'creator' marketplaces across the region, championing influencers like Saputra, and negotiating data deals with telecoms firms to keep a lid on consumers' smartphone bills, according to interviews with current and former staffers.
It's chasing small to medium-sized businesses as advertisers - nearly nine out of every 10 firms in Southeast Asia are classified as small - complete with how-to-advertise seminars, millions of dollars in advertising credits, and a self-service platform for businesses to make their own ads.
TikTok is piloting live-streaming commercial initiatives pioneered in China, Southeast Asia business marketing head Chew Wee Ng said in an interview with Reuters. Meanwhile ByteDance is heavily promoting sister apps like Singapore-headquartered business messaging service Lark and music streaming service Resso.
""TikTok is really unique in that people expect to see advertisers and they want to co-create with brands,"" said Ng, a former Google executive based in Singapore.
According to data from app analytics firm Sensor Tower, TikTok has had more than 360 millions downloads in Southeast Asia, nearly half of them in Indonesia, with 151% growth year-on-year for 2020.
An internal ByteDance 2019 presentation reviewed by Reuters showed that last year TikTok had 43.5 million monthly active users in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, with the majority female, the biggest online consumers in the region.
The app grew staggeringly fast in recent months, sources said, as lockdowns enforced across the region to tackle the coronavirus pandemic forced people to stay home. In Indonesia, Saputra said he's been acquiring 100,000 followers every three days.
LOCAL MODERATORS
With growth has come increased government scrutiny, but ByteDance has already had plenty of experience dealing with that. As on other business matters, ByteDance declined to comment on its handling of scrutiny.
Indonesia presented one of its first major global policy challenges in 2018, after authorities briefly banned TikTok for posts they said contained ""pornography, inappropriate content and blasphemy"".
Within 24 hours, the firm had dispatched senior executives to negotiate with Indonesia, promising to raise the age of its users and to hire a team of local moderators, according to sources and to the-then Indonesian communications minister.
It would quickly copy this approach by installing moderators across its Southeast Asian markets in a bid to insure compliance with local laws.
Reuters reported in August that from 2018 until 2020, ByteDance censored content that it perceived as critical of the Chinese government on a news aggregator app in Indonesia known as BaBe at the behest of ByteDance's China headquarters.
As of August 2020, most of the content guidelines have been localised for individual Southeast Asian countries. That has often meant strict censorship of local political content.
In Thailand, where a youth protest movement is challenging the country's monarchy, some users told Reuters their pro-protest videos had been taken down.
'IN VIETNAM, CHINA IS POLITICAL'
In Vietnam, TikTok has blocked most political content for years, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company declined to comment.
Hanoi has been in a long-running conflict with U.S. tech giants over demands to restrict any content deemed against the state and create local offices in Vietnam.
Reuters reported in April that Facebook agreed to increase censorship of ""anti-state"" posts in Vietnam after its local servers were temporarily taken off-line.
ByteDance, which unlike big U.S. tech players does have an office in the country, decided to pre-empt issues with the government by promising to make its app 'non-political'.
Due to Vietnam's contentious relationship with China, ByteDance decided it would also ban content critical of Beijing, and anything related to tensions between the two governments.
""In Vietnam, China is political,"" one source said.
The approach has been effective. TikTok now counts Vietnam, a multi-billion dollar market for social media firms, as among its most profitable in Asia, according to sources with knowledge of the matter, while launching regular campaigns with authorities on safety and tourism.
Back in West Java, Sandy Saputra aims to keep on flashing grins and goofing around on TikTok.
""To me, this isn't a job,"" he said, before breaking away into another dance routine. ""It's a hobby that makes money.""",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/kfcs-first-outlet-in-srinagar-beats-companys-sales-estimates-in-ten-days/articleshow/77804216.cms,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/tiktok-booms-in-southeast-asia-as-it-picks-path-through-political-minefields-5765851.html

JOHANNESBURG, Aug 28 (Reuters) - South African retailer Steinhoff International Holdings on Friday reported a 6% decline in sales for the nine-months to June 30, due to COVID-19-related trading restrictions imposed worldwide. 
Steinhoff, which is also listed in Frankfurt, said sales from continuing operations for the period fell to 6.8 billion euros ($8.08 billion) from 7.2 billion euros in the same period the previous year. 
The retailer said while almost all of its stores had reopened by the end of June, a significant amount of trade had been lost while they were closed. 
“Since lockdown restrictions began to be lifted from early May, revenues are trending back to, and in some cases above, pre-COVID-19 levels,” the retailer said, 
Its cash position from operations at the end of the period was better than what it had estimated at the beginning of the pandemic. 
Sales at Pepkor Holdings, a majority-owned subsidiary based in South Africa, fell 10% while sales of furniture retailer Conforama and Greenlit Brands, a household goods retailer and manufacturer in Australia and New Zealand, declined 18% and 1% respectively. 
Pepco Group, another subsidiary which owns British discount retailer Poundland, was the only retailer to lift sales by 2% as revenue recovered when restrictions were eased. 
Steinhoff said Poundland continued to reduce its property costs by renegotiating 100 store leases during the period. 
Plans to possibly list its Australian Fantastic Group retailer remain in the early stages, with no definitive decision taken yet, the retailer said.

The coronavirus toll in the United States topped 180,000 Thursday as officials braced for another surge as schools are reopening. Several US Midwest states reported record single-day spikes as governors said they would not reduce testing as recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
On Thursday, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota all recorded their biggest one-day increases in new infections since the pandemic began. Although nationally new cases, deaths and positivity rates are on decline, new hotspots are emerging in the country’s Midwest.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)The South Korean government is set to extend the current “Phase 2” social distancing for at least another week. Despite recording another triple-digit increase in daily new coronavirus cases, South Korean authorities on Friday stopped short of shifting the country up to the highest level of social distancing measures. “Phase 3 social distancing is the choice of last resort given the economic and social ripple effect,”Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun instead said.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 371 new coronavirus cases as of midnight Thursday, bringing the country’s total to 19,077, including 316 deaths. Health authorities had reimposed Phase 2 social distancing rules on August 16 in the Seoul metropolitan area, expanding the measures nationwide last week.

(Source: Getty Images/Representational)Britain on Friday said it will back three nationwide COVID-19 studies with 8.4 million pounds to fund research into understanding human immune responses to the coronavirus pandemic. These studies are set to help scientists develop better immunity tests, study the body’s immune response tothe virus and understand why it impacts different people in different degrees.
“Together, it is hoped these studies will improve the treatment of patients and inform the development of vaccines and therapies,” the funding bodies said in a joint statement.
“Importantly, these studies will determine when and how immunity persists or whether people can become re-infected (with COVID-19),” the statement added.

5481084,0,0,"China stocks climb on upbeat economic data, listings momentum",Markets higher as Fed chair says interest rates to stay low,"HONG KONG: The Chinese stock market climbed on Friday, with blue-chip shares clocking their best week in four, as sentiment was supported by improving economic data and a slew of new listings.
The Shanghai Composite index closed up 1.6 per cent at 3,403.81. The blue-chip CSI300 index jumped 2.4 per cent. 
Stocks clung on to a momentum this week that was fuelled by upbeat data showing improving industrial profits and a surge in the start-up Chinext board.
The CSI300 rose 2.7 per cent this week - its best in four - and Shanghai shares up 0.7 per cent for the week, their best in three.
Historic reforms that saw relaxation in listing requirements and trading rules of the Shenzhen stock bourse, brought 18 companies to the start-up Chinext board this week.
The smaller Shenzhen index added almost 2 per cent, ChiNext gained 2.6 per cent while the tech-focused STAR50 fell 0.3 per cent.
A surge in Chinext volumes and a rebound in earnings of companies in the Shanghai market aided investor sentiment this week, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.
They said second-quarter earnings season was more than half way through and Chinese firms had beaten estimates significantly, supporting their view that corporate earnings troughed in the first quarter and would stay on track for a recovery and achieve positive growth for 2020.
Founder Securities said investors should focus on individual stocks and not index-level volatility, and prepare for the listing of Ant Group, while China Central Securities recommended blue-chips that may pick up in a catch-up rally. 
Ant Group, Alibaba's fintech arm, filed for a dual listing this week in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market on Tuesday, which could be the world's largest IPO. 
The yuan was 0.38 per cent stronger at 6.8681 per U.S. dollar at 0714 GMT. About 27.13 billion shares were traded on the Shanghai exchange, more than the previous trading session's 23.71 billion.","Asian markets were mostly higher on Friday after the Federal Reserve said it might keep interest rates low even if inflation rises, in a major overhaul to its strategy.
Shares rose in Japan, South Korea, Shanghai and Hong Kong but fell in Sydney.
Overnight, the S&amp;P 500 ticked 0.2% higher, further into record territory and closing at 3,484.55, after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said in a speech that it might keep interest rates low to help prop up the pandemic ravaged economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2%.
The hoped for change in the Fed's strategy is a huge deal for markets that have been rescued by central banks slashing short-term interest rates and buying all kinds of bonds.
Japan's consumer price index rose 0.3% in July, the government reported, down from 0.6% the month before.
The Bank of Japan has kept interest rates near or even below zero for most of the past decade, seeking to spur inflation and entice companies and consumers to spend more. It has yet to see inflation hit the 2% target set by its governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, in 2013.
Kuroda has said he will do what he can to support the economy but that central bank policy cannot ensure sustainable long-term growth.
The disruptions dealt by the coronavirus pandemic have pushed many economies into downturns, causing demand and upward pressure on prices to soften. Low interest rates keep credit cheap to encourage investment and other spending.
With the adoption of allowing inflation to overshoot their target, the Fed is slowly becoming the BOJ,"" Edward Moya of Oanda said in a commentary. The Fed did not give any hints on how they will achieve inflation and that is why no one is buying that it will happen anytime soon.""
In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index gained 0.4% to 23,292.80 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.6% to 25,428.47. The Kospi in Seoul jumped 1.1% to 2,369.73. Sydney's S&amp;P/ASX 200 was flat, at 6,067.90, while the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher, to 3,352.58.
Shares fell in Taiwan but rose in Southeast Asia.
On Wall Street, prices for stocks, bonds and gold all made several U-turns after Powell's highly anticipated speech. In it, he essentially said the Fed may continue efforts to prop up the economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2%, as long as it had been weak before then.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6% to 28,492.27, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.3% to 11,625.34 after paring an earlier loss of 1%.
With its fifth straight day of gains, the S&amp;P 500's has climbed 56% since late March after the immense support of the Fed helped halt its earlier free-fall and erase its pandemic losses.
Low interest rates often act like steroids for stocks, allowing their prices to rise faster than corporate profits.
The era of easy money is here, said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury was at 0.78%, up from 0.68% late Wednesday. The 30-year yield climbed to 1.50% from 1.41%.
A report Thursday showed the pace of layoffs sweeping the country remains incredibly high but may be slowing. A little more than 1 million US workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, down slightly from just over 1.1 million the week before.
In another report, the government also said that the economy looks like it shrank at an annual rate of 31.7% in the spring quarter. That would be the sharpest quarterly drop on record, but it's not as bad as the Commerce Department's earlier estimate of 32.9%.
Financial stocks had the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;P 500, up 1.7%. A higher 10-year Treasury yield allows for higher rates on mortgages and other loans, which boosts profits for banks. JPMorgan Chase gained 3.3%, and Wells Fargo rose 2.3%.
Benchmark US crude oil lost 5 cents to $42.99 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell 35 cents to settle at $43.04 per barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 1 cent to $45.61 per barrel.
In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar bought 106.91 Japanese yen, down from 106.57 yen late Thursday. The euro rose to $1.1844 from $1.1823.

Aug 28 (Reuters) - Gold rebounded over 2% on Friday, a day after a steep sell-off, as the U.S. dollar weakened and the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled a prolonged low interest rate strategy. 
Spot gold rose 2.1% to $1,968.59 per ounce by 12:41 pm EDT (1641 GMT), taking gains this week to about 1.5%. Prices fell as much as 2.2% on Thursday after U.S. Treasury yields gained following Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech. 
U.S. gold futures rose 2.5% to $1,980.90. 
“The sizeable sell-off in the greenback has propped up gold,” said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. 
“The Fed said it can allow inflation to run above its 2% target for some time seems like they are going to keep their monetary policy extremely loose, which should help gold.” 
The dollar fell to an more than one-week low, making gold cheaper for holders of other currencies, and was on track to post its biggest weekly percentage fall since end-July. 
Powell said on Thursday the central bank would adopt an average inflation target, meaning rates are likely to stay low even if inflation rises a bit in future. 
On the other hand, global central banks and governments have pumped massive stimulus into the market to prop up their coronavirus damaged economies, helping gold gain over 28% this year. 
“The shift in Fed policy will mostly likely reignite ‘the inflation trade,’ which has historically been bullish for hard assets (like gold),” Kitco Metals senior analyst Jim Wyckoff said in a note. 
Low interest rates tend to support gold, which is also a hedge against inflation and currency depreciation. 
Silver rose 1.8% to $27.53 per ounce, on track for a second consecutive weekly rise. 
Platinum gained 0.1% to $929.49, while palladium rose 2.1% to $2,206.54.

Richard Chang and Dan Grebler","Gold climbed as investors weighed the impact of the Federal Reserve’s new approach to setting U.S. monetary policy, with a more relaxed stance on inflation.
Chair Jerome Powell said that the Fed will seek inflation that averages 2 per cent over time, a step that implies allowing for price gains to overshoot. He also noted that “if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal,” the central bank wouldn’t hesitate to act.
Gold climbs as investors weigh Fed's comments on inflation
Bullion swung sharply Thursday as investors parsed the speech delivered virtually for the Fed’s annual policy symposium traditionally held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It rallied to an all-time high earlier this month as governments and central banks employed stimulus measures to curb the coronavirus pandemic’s damage on economies.
Higher inflation tolerance and low interest rates should see U.S. real yields fall in the medium-to-longer term, which is supportive of gold, said Vivek Dhar, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Still, the fact that the Fed will also act if there are inflationary pressures adds doubt to how high U.S. 10-year inflation expectations can reach, he said.
“The near V-shape rebound in U.S. 10-year inflation expectations since mid-March is at risk of stalling,” said Dhar. “This is negative for gold and has outweighed the Fed’s inflation-tolerance comments likely because gold markets weren’t expecting Powell’s intolerance for inflation getting too high.”

Spot gold advanced 0.6 per cent to $1,941 an ounce at 12:28 p.m. in Singapore. On Thursday, prices slumped as much as 2.3 per cent after rising 1.1 per cent.
The Fed’s shift to let inflation and employment run higher may signal that policy makers will keep interest rates low for years to come, lifting the appeal of non-interest-bearing gold.
“Gold bulls initially rejoiced the announcement of seeking inflation to average 2 per cent over time, but then quickly came crashing down after noting the inflation overshoots could be moderate,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp., said in a note. After the “record long expansion failed to yield inflation, Wall Street is skeptical that the Fed will really see inflation anytime soon even when the economy is beyond the coronavirus.”
Since the central bank officially set its inflation target at 2 per cent in 2012, the Fed’s preferred measure of price increases has consistently fallen short of that objective, averaging just 1.4 per cent. That challenge was part of the impetus for the strategy review. Low inflation contributes to low interest rates, which reduces the Fed’s ability to fight off economic downturns -- potentially making them deeper and longer.
“While the Fed will likely need to ramp up their asset purchases to support the economy, they didn’t provide any signs that will happen soon,” Moya said. “Gold’s path back to record high territory is still there, it will just take a while longer to get there.”",https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL4N2FU441,https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/gold-advances-as-investors-weigh-us-fed-s-new-approach-on-inflation-120082800406_1.html
3487939,0,0,Russia releases secret footage of 1961 'Tsar Bomba' hydrogen blast - Reuters,Whats next after Japan PM Shinzo Abe quits? Potential successors?,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has released previously classified footage of the world’s largest nuclear explosion, caused when the Soviet Union detonated the so-called Tsar Bomba almost 60 years ago. 
The hydrogen bomb, which carried the force of 50 million tons of conventional explosives, was detonated in a test in October 1961, 4,000 metres over the remote Novaya Zemlya archipelago above the Arctic Circle. 
The footage shows an immense fireball and a 60-km high mushroom cloud rising after the explosion lit up the sky. The views were captured from several angles by cameras installed on the ground and on board two Soviet aircraft. 
“The testing of an exceptionally powerful hydrogen load ... confirmed that the Soviet Union is in possession of a thermo-nuclear weapon with power of 50 megatons, 100 megatons and more,” a narrator tells the audience. 
The documentary was published online for the first time by Russian state nuclear agency Rosatom last week as part of events to mark 75th anniversary of Russia’s atomic industry. 
Developed between 1956 and 1961 as the Soviet Union engaged in a nuclear arms race with the United States, the Tsar Bomba - the King of Bombs - was the largest hydrogen bomb ever and was claimed to be 3,300 times as destructive as the weapon that levelled Hiroshima. 
The 30-minute film, which opens with a ‘Top secret’ title, features all the test stages - from transportation of a 26-ton weapon in an aviation bomb casing by railway, to post-explosion measurements of the radioactive fallout. 
The Tsar Bomba far surpassed the largest explosion the United States has ever conducted - a 15-megaton “Castle Bravo” hydrogen bomb detonated on Bikini Atoll in 1954. 
Reporting by Maria Vasilyeva; Editing by Sujata Rao and Giles Elgood","The abrupt news that Japan's longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe is set to resign over a worsening health condition, set off a flurry of attention on Friday over the path ahead for the world's third-biggest economy.
His resignation announcement, expected Friday evening, will trigger an election in his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to replace him as its president, followed by a vote in parliament to elect a new prime minister.
Abe and his cabinet would continue to run the government until a new premier is elected but could not adopt new policies. The winner of the party election would then hold the post until the end of Abes LDP term in September 2021.
The new party president is virtually assured the premiership, since the party has a majority in parliaments lower house.
Usually, the party must announce the election for its leader a month in advance, and its MPs vote along with grassroots members. In case of a sudden resignation, however, an extraordinary vote must be called at the soonest date possible with participants narrowed to MPs and representatives of the partys local chapters.
Here are details of some likely contenders to take the helm.
TARO ASO
Finance minister Aso, 79, who also doubles as deputy prime minister, has been a core member of Abe's administration. Without a clear consensus on who should succeed Abe, LDP lawmakers could elect Aso as a temporary leader if Abe resigns.
In 2008, Aso was elected LDP leader and hence, premier, in hopes that he could revive the long-dominant party's fortunes. Instead, the LDP was ousted in a historic election defeat in 2009, languishing in the opposition for the next three years.
The grandson of a former premier, Aso mixes policy experience with a fondness for manga comics and a tendency towards gaffes.
SHIGERU ISHIBA
A hawkish former defence minister and rare LDP critic of Abe, Ishiba, 63, regularly tops surveys of lawmakers whom voters want to see as the next premier, but is less popular with the party's lawmakers.
The soft-spoken security maven has also held portfolios for agriculture and reviving local economies.
He defeated Abe in the first round of a party presidential election in 2012, thanks to strong grassroots support, but lost in the second round when only MPs could vote. Then, in a 2018 party leadership poll, Ishiba lost heavily to Abe.
He has criticised the Bank of Japan's ultra-low interest rates for hurting regional banks and called for higher public works spending to remedy growing inequality.
FUMIO KISHIDA
Kishida, 63, served as foreign minister under Abe from 2012 to 2017, but diplomacy remained mainly in the prime minister's grip.
The low-key lawmaker from Hiroshima has been widely seen as Abe's preferred successor but ranks low in voter surveys.
Kishida hails from one of the party's more dovish factions and is seen as less keen on revising the post-war constitution's pacifist Article 9 than Abe, for whom it is a cherished goal.
The BOJ's hyper-easy monetary policy ""cannot go on forever,"" Kishida has said.
TARO KONO
Defence Minister Taro Kono, 56, has a reputation as a maverick but has toed the line on key Abe policies, including a stern stance in a feud with South Korea over wartime history.
Educated at Georgetown University and a fluent English speaker, he previously served as foreign minister and minister for administrative reform.
He has differentiated his conservative stances from those of his father, former chief cabinet secretary Yohei Kono, who authored a landmark 1993 apology to comfort women, a euphemism for women forced to work in Japan's wartime military brothels.
YOSHIHIDE SUGA
Suga, 71, a self-made politician and loyal lieutenant since Abe's troubled term as premier in 2006 and 2007, was among a band of allies who pushed Abe to run again for the top post in 2012.
Back in office, Abe tapped Suga as chief cabinet secretary, acting as top government spokesman, coordinating policies and keeping bureaucrats in line.
Talk of Suga as a contender bubbled up in April 2019 after he unveiled the new imperial era name, ""Reiwa"", for use on Japanese calendars after the enthronement of the new emperor.
Suga's clout was dented somewhat by scandals that toppled two cabinet ministers close to him last October.
SHINJIRO KOIZUMI
The name of Koizumi, 39, now environment minister and the son of charismatic former premier Junichiro Koizumi, is often floated as a future premier, but many consider him too young.
He shares some of Abes conservative views and has paid his respects at Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni Shrine for war dead.
Koizumi has projected a reforming image on the basis of efforts to cut Japan's backing for coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, but has typically taken care not to offend party elders.
TOSHIMITSU MOTEGI
Currently foreign minister, Motegi, 64, previously served as economy minister, facing off with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in tough negotiations.
He also served as trade minister post under Abe when the latter returned to power in 2012, tackling talks on the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact.
Educated at the University of Tokyo and Harvard, Motegi was first elected to the lower house in 1993 from the then-opposition Japan New Party and joined the LDP in 1995.
KATSUNOBU KATO, YASUTOSHI NISHIMURA
As health minister, Kato, 64, was in the limelight in the early days of Japan's coronavirus outbreak but then Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, 57, a former trade official, emerged as point person on virus policy.
In 2015, Kato, a father of four, was handed the portfolio for boosting Japan's rock-bottom birth rate, a task that met little success. He is a former official of the finance ministry.
SEIKO NODA
Noda, 59, has made no secret of her desire to become Japan's first female premier. An Abe critic, the former internal affairs minister, who also held the portfolio for women's empowerment, fell short of backing to join the race for party leader in 2018.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-nuclear-tsar-bomba-idUSKBN25O1U9,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/whats-next-after-japan-pm-shinzo-abe-quits-potential-successors-5767421.html
2206025,0,0,Prajnesh Gunneswaran suffers US Open heartbreak despite long New York trip,US faces tough challenge at UN Security Council over Iran sanctions,"By: Reuters | 
Published: August 28, 2020 9:35:55 pm
Prajnesh Gunneswarans compatriot Sumit Nagal was the last man to get a direct entry in the initial list. (Source: File)Prajnesh Gunneswaran flew halfway across the world in the hope of sneaking into the U.S. Opens main draw but suffered an expensive let-down when he missed out by a single spot.
The tournaments organisers (USTA) did not hold qualifiers this year in a bid to reduce the number of people in their bio-secure bubble in New York and Gunneswarans compatriot Sumit Nagal was the last man to get a direct entry in the initial list.
Yet with many players deciding against travelling to New York due to the pandemic, the Chennai-based Gunneswaran, who was ranked five spots behind Nagal at 132 when the initial entries were announced, felt he still had a chance.
I wanted to give myself the opportunity to play another slam, I wanted to make the effort to come here and see what happens, the 30-year-old told Reuters in an interview.
Reaching the singles main draw at a tennis Grand Slam is considered a success in itself in cricket-mad India and Gunneswaran has previous experience of disappointment.
He was on the cusp of his Grand Slam debut as a lucky loser at Roland Garros in 2018 when Australian Nick Kyrgios withdrew late due to an injury.
Yet the Indian had already left Paris to travel to Italy for an ATP Challenger event following his loss in the third and final round of qualifying for the French Open.
He went on to qualify for his first main draw appearance at last years Australian Open, where he lost to American Frances Tiafoe in the first round, and has played in all Grand Slams since Melbourne.
Gunneswaran arrived in New York the night before Thursdays U.S. Open draw and watched Egypts Mohamed Safwat, placed just ahead of him in the list of alternates, sneak in.
When I was three out when I left (India), I felt I had no chance or very low chance. And then all of a sudden a couple of guys pulled out and I was one out, he said from the United States by phone.
I was hoping that maybe some sort of a miracle could happen, but unfortunately it didnt.
There could still be more U.S. Open withdrawals before it begins on Monday but the USTAs COVID-19 protocols mean that vacant spots will be filled from the doubles draw.
In a year when professional tennis players earned nothing for over five months due to the pandemic, Gunneswaran spent thousands of dollars to be at the Open and will now have to plan his travel ahead to the European claycourt events.
I am disappointed but I also have to accept the fact that Im in this position based on my ranking, said Gunneswaran, who reached a career-high 75 last year but has slipped to 136.
I have to get better if I want to guarantee myself positions in the main draws.

For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App.","The United States and most of the rest of the UN Security Council dug in their heels Thursday on diametrically opposed positions over the restoration of international sanctions on Iran.
In increasingly intense rhetorical terms, US officials insisted they had acted legitimately in triggering a so-called snapback mechanism that would re-impose all UN sanctions Iran next month. They said the re-imposition of sanctions is a done deal and nothing can stop it.
Last week, the U.S. triggered the 30-day process to restore virtually all UN sanctions on Iran after the Security Council failed to uphold its mission to maintain international peace and security, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a tweet.
These sanctions will snap back at midnight GMT on September 20. But as they did when Pompeo traveled to the U.N. to invoke snapback, almost all other council members flatly rejected that position, repeating their position that the U.S. had lost its legal standing to act after President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal two years ago.
At the heart of the dispute is the Security Council resolution that endorsed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, between Iran and six major powers the U.S., Russia, China, United Kingdom, France and Germany.
It allows a JCPOA participant state to trigger the snapback mechanism. The U.S. insists that as an original JCPOA participant it has the legal right even though it ceased participating in 2018.
The impasse sets the stage for a potential crisis in the Security Council next month with the United States claiming to have re-imposed the sanctions and most of the rest of the world saying the Trump administration's action is illegal and ignoring it.
The president of the council on Tuesday said there was overwhelming opposition in the 15-member body to the U.S. position and that it was unlikely there would be any action on Washington's demand.
But Pompeo said that wouldn't matter, citing the process for sanctions re-imposition outlined in council resolution that enshrined the nuclear deal. Under the terms of that resolution, if a participant in the deal accuses Iran of significant non-performance, the council must vote affirmatively to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. would veto any such resolution.
If any member of the UN Security Council introduces a resolution to continue sanctions relief, the U.S. will oppose it, Pompeo said. If no resolution is introduced, the sanctions on Iran will still return on September 20. That's how UNSCR 2231 works.
The European Union's foreign policy chief, who coordinates the JCPOA's Joint Commission, reiterated in response to Pompeo's latest statement that since the U.S. withdrew from the agreement in 2018 it cannot ... be considered to be a JCPOA participant state for the purposes of possible sanctions snapback foreseen by the resolution.
EU High Representative Josep Borrell added that he will continue to do everything possible to ensure the preservation and full implementation of the JCPOA by all, saying it remains a key pillar of global nonproliferation that contributes to regional stability.
The six remaining parties to the JCPOA are scheduled to hold a virtual meeting on Sept. 1.
Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky tweeted Thursday: Under intl law you can't withdraw from an agreement and then claim you can still benefit from its provisions. Under 'rules-based intl order' where the rules are defined by the US this seems to be OK provided it serves US interests.
The Trump administration has been waging war on the nuclear deal for years. During the 2016 presidential campaign candidate Trump denounced it as the worst deal ever negotiated and has made no secret of his desire to blow it up. U.S. officials say the deal is fatally flawed because certain restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity gradually expire and will allow the country to eventually develop atomic weapons.
JCPOA supporters warn that if the deal blows up or Iran pulls out it could pursue nuclear weapons.
Pompeo came to the United Nations last week to demand restoration of U.N. sanctions after the Security Council resoundingly rejected a U.S. resolution to indefinitely extend the U.N. arms embargo on Iran, which is set to expire Oct. 18, in one of the first restrictions to be lifted. Only the Dominican Republic supported the United States.
Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who has long questioned the validity of the administration's argument for snapback, told The Associated Press: The lesson you take away from this is for the United States it's perfectly honorable to stand alone at the U.N. in vindication of our principles. But at least you ought to try and do it smartly, and not so that you look foolish. I think we look foolish, he said.
And what we're going to see here is what happens when you get into this kind of foolishness. It really is too cute by half and now it is coming back to bite the United States, and it was entirely predictable.

6205907,0,0,Secretary accuses minister of `63.91-cr scam  he says ready to face any inquiry,"GST council meeting: Unacceptable, say States reacting to Centre#39;s options on meeting GST shortfall","Later, a government statement quoted him as saying he was willing to face any inquiry and action even if an iota of truth is found in the allegations. Additional Chief Secretary (Social Justice, Empowerment and Minorities) Kripa Shankar Saroj has held his departments minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and Congress MLA B S Dhaliwal responsible for a scam of Rs 63.91crore in the Post-Matric SC Scholarship scheme of the Centre. The minister has denied the charges.
In his report to Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan, submitted on August 21, Saroj has stated, Under the PMS-SC scheme the GOI sent Rs 303 crore to Punjab during February -March 2019. Though the Directorate of Social Justice withdrew Rs 248 crore from the treasury, however, the department had then distributed this sum in an arbitrary manner. Significantly, records pertaining to Rs 39 crore are missing. Either this sum has been embezzled or paid to some ghost institutions.
Further, he has stated: Interestingly, an amount of Rs 16.91 crore was paid to such institutions against which the audit team had recommended a recovery of Rs 8 crore, thus costing the state exchequer Rs 24.91 crore. If the amount of recoveries which the audit team had concluded are added to this Rs 16.91 crore, then these officials had cost the exchequer to the tune of Rs 24.91 crore. The minister and his team of officers worked in tandem.
Payments were made to even those institutions which had been found out as defaulters by the FD audit team. Instead of effecting recoveries from those institutions, heavy payments were made at the level of Deputy Director, Parminder Singh Gill, the report states.
Saroj has also said that it was learnt that Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal, IAS, and the then director in the department was having an agenda to enter politics and contest the seat of an MLA. Gill, the then director in-charge of all important schemes of the department, was reporting directly to the minister.
Also, because the minister had himself assigned the work of PMS-SC to the Deputy Director P S Gill under his own signature, hence the Deputy Director was answerable to none except the minister. Dhaliwal is Phagwara MLA. He had contested Assembly by-election from there in last October.
As he enjoyed total powers, for almost three months (from second week of August 2019 to December 10, 2019), not even a single paper was put for approval of the Director or the Secretary. The minister was then sent a note requesting him that powers to distribute work among Deputy Directors may be restored to the Director. The minister simply turned down the note writing that directions be followed as per standing orders of the department, the report adds.
The report also says that P S Gill is considered close to Dharamsot. He had cleared several files on his own. After an audit report in December 2019, the then Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh had ordered suspension of Gill, but the minister had reversed the orders.
Dharamsot, when contacted, said he did not want to say anything as whatever he had to say, it was telecast on TV channels, where he was heard accusing his departmental secretary of venting out his anger against him as he had not allowed some transfers and postings recommended by the official.
Later, a government statement quoted him as saying he was willing to face any inquiry and action even if an iota of truth is found in the allegations.
Dharamsot also said that the charges were outrightly malicious, absurd and were politically motivated.There are some vested interests who cannot digest the fact that our SC students are getting good facilities and education during Captain Amarinder Singh government. It is a conspiracy to cast aspersions on state governments efficient working. The vicious attempts are a ploy to ensure the scheme gets stalled and our students dont get quality education, he added.
Reiterating his personal commitment to ensure uplift of SC students, Dharamsot said what the present state government has been doing for underprivileged students has been unparallel. Punjab has maximum population of SC students for whom we are duty-bound to ensure proper educational facilities, he said.
Pointing out that it has been Punjab government which has been continuously fighting with Centre to get the scholarship amount on time. Even today, Rs 1,550 crore is being withheld by Centre for which I have been daily taking up the issue.
He said the state government has received Rs 811 crore from the Centre during last three years which have been already distributed. The department is already in the process of distributing Rs 309 crore grant at present.

For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App.","The Centre on August 27 placed before the Goods and Services Tax Council two options for borrowing by states to meet the shortfall in GST revenues, pegged at Rs 2.3 lakh crore in the current fiscal.
Briefing reporters after the 41st GST Council meeting, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the economy is facing an extraordinary 'Act of God' situation, which may result in economic contraction.

Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said that a special window can be provided to the states, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), at a reasonable interest rate for borrowing of Rs 97,000 crore.
The amount can be repaid after five years (of GST implementation) ending 2022 from cess collection.
The second option before the states is to borrow the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore shortfall under the special window. ""States have been given seven days' time to think over the proposal,"" Pandey said.
Heres how states reacted to the Centres proposal:
&gt; The Kerala government termed the two options as ""unacceptable"".
Opposing the options for the GST compensation proposed by FM Sitharaman, Keralas Finance Minister TM Thomas Isaac said in both options the states will have to sacrifice a part of the compensation. He made it clear that full compensation was a constitutional right of the states.
""Full compensation is constitutional right of states. Unacceptable.#GSTCouncilMeet,"" Isaac said in a tweet on August 27.
&gt; Delhis Finance Minister Manish Sisodia accused the Centre of ""betraying"" federalism by refusing to pay GST compensation to states, and demanded it take loan from the RBI on behalf of the city government which he said is facing a revenue shortfall
However, under the current hybrid system (of governance), the Delhi government cannot take a loan from the RBI. The Centre should take a loan from the RBI on behalf of the Delhi government,"" he said.
Sisodia, also Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister, said the city government estimates a revenue shortfall of around Rs 21,000 crore in the current financial year.

&gt; Punjabs Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal government said the options given by Centre are not acceptable.
""The solution was thrust upon us. The amount will be repaid from the compensation cess which will continue for 2-3 more years. This is not acceptable to Punjab,"" Badal said, adding that the compensation amount due to the state is Rs 6,500 crore for April-July.
He said 25 percent of state's tax base was subsumed in GST because there was assurance from the Centre on compensation. ""It is one thing to say that there are no funds, but it is another thing to say that there is no commitment to provide compensation for revenue loss,"" Badal said.
&gt; However, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi said since borrowing would be funded from cess collected beyond five years, which is beginning 2022-23 fiscal, there would be no burden on state exchequer for repayment of either principal or interest component of the loan.
Sushil Modi, who also holds the finance portfolio in Bihar, said there would be no scope of defaulting on loan since repayment is guaranteed from levy of cess.

4495645,0,0,Over 400 million poor now have access to banks due to Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana: Finance minis... - Hindustan Times,Housing ministry advises states to reduce stamp duty on property transactions,"The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), the country’s financial inclusion initiative that was launched six years ago, has more than 403.5 million accounts with total deposits in excess of Rs 1.30 lakh crore, the Union finance ministry said.
The scheme, which has become the basis of direct transfer of cash subsidy to the poor, was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech on August 15, 2014, and was launched on August 28 that year.
“Today, six years ago, the PMJDY was launched with an ambitious aim of banking the unbanked. This initiative has been a game-changer, serving as the foundation for several poverty alleviation initiatives, benefitting crores of people,” PM Modi tweeted on Friday.
The government is planning to expand the scheme to provide insurance coverage to PMJDY account holders. “Eligible PMJDY account holders will be sought to be covered under PMJJBY [Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana] and PMSBY [Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana]. Banks have already been communicated about the same,” it said in a statement.
The government is also planning to promote digital payments, including RuPay debit card usage, among PMJDY account holders through creation of acceptance infrastructure across the country and provide access of the account holders to micro-credit and micro investment facilities, it added. 
According to the statement, as on August 19, out of the total PMJDY account holders, 63.6% were in rural areas and 55.2% accounts belonged to women. “Thanks to the PMJDY, the future of several families has become secure. A high proportion of beneficiaries are from rural areas and are women,” the PM said in another tweet.
Financial inclusion is a national priority of the government, as it is an enabler for inclusive growth, the finance ministry said. “It is important as it provides an avenue to the poor for bringing their savings into the formal financial system, an avenue to remit money to their families in villages besides taking them out of the clutches of the usurious money lenders,” it added.
“The PMJDY has been the foundation stone for the Modi government’s people-centric economic initiatives. Whether it is direct benefit transfers (DBTs), coronavirus disease (Covid-19) financial assistance, PM-KISAN, increased wages under the MGNREGA [Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005], life and health insurance cover, the first step was to provide every adult with a bank account, which PMJDY has nearly completed,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.
The PMJDY became an important instrument to expeditiously provide relief to the poor under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package that was announced on March 26. The package provided an amount of Rs 500 per month for three months to women PMJDY account holders. 
“A total of Rs 30,705 crore have been credited in accounts of women PMJDY account holders during April-June,” the statement said. 
Besides, about 80 million PMJDY account holders receive DBT from the government under various schemes.
The scheme involves opening of basic savings bank deposit accounts with minimal paperwork. The process of account opening is simple with relaxed know-your-customer (KYC) norms. These accounts are zero balance and zero charge accounts. Account holders are issued indigenous debit cards with free accident insurance coverage of Rs 2 lakh.
In August, about 86.3% (348.1 million) accounts were operative, the statement said. 
As per the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), a PMJDY account is treated as inoperative, if there are no customer induced transactions in the account for over a period of two years. 
At present, these accounts have a deposit balance of Rs 1.31 lakh crore, with an average deposit of Rs 3,239 per account. The average deposit per account has increased 2.5 times, which indicates increased usage of accounts and inculcation of saving habit among the account holders, it said.
The PMJDY account holders can also take help of ‘Jan Dhan Darshak App’, a mobile application, for locating banking touchpoints such as bank branches, automated teller machines (ATMs), Bank Mitras and post offices, it said.
There are over eight lakh banking touchpoints, it added.","New Delhi: Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra on Friday hailed the Maharashtra government's decision to reduce stamp duty on registration of properties and advised other states to do the same to boost demand in the real estate sector.
Addressing a webinar organised by industry body PHDCCI, he assured the industry that the ministry would examine its various demands, including one regarding need for a change in income tax law to enable builders reduce their selling prices of apartments.
The secretary said an investment of Rs 9,300 crore has been approved from the Rs 25,000-crore stress fund, which was set up to complete the stalled housing projects across the country.
On the demand for stamp duty reduction to boost sluggish sales during this COVID-19 pandemic, Mishra said, ""We had given suggestions to all the states to reduce it. The Maharashtra government has done it. We will pursue with others (states). It's a good step by the Maharashtra government. It will have a positive impact on cost reduction.""
On Wednesday, the Maharashtra government decided to slash stamp duty on sale deed documents by 3 per cent from September 1 to December 31, 2020, and by 2 per cent from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021. Currently, the rate is 5 per cent in urban area and 4 per cent in rural area.
Stamp duty is the transactional tax, collected by the government on property purchases. It is one of the major sources of revenue.
Mishra asked the industry to send its suggestion related to change in the income tax law for enabling builders to reduce prices without incurring any tax liabilities.
Gaurs Group Managing Director Manoj Gaur said if builders reduce prices more than 10 per cent below ready reckoner rates, there is an additional tax burden on developers and also buyers.
""We will examine your suggestion. If we are satisfied, we will take up this issue with the finance ministry,"" Mishra said.
The secretary said there has been considerable improvement in ease of doing business in the real estate sector and construction permits are being given online.
Mishra also clarified that public sector companies and development authorities involved in building and selling real estate projects would have to be registered under the RERA law.
On the newly launched Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHC) scheme for migrants and urban poor, he said this would be a game changer in creating market for rental housing.
Mishra said the government has finalised model tenancy law and is likely to be approved in the next one months. It will then be sent to states/UTs for adoption.
The model tenancy law has been further simplified compared to the draft proposal, he said.
The ministry had in July 2019 floated the draft model tenancy law, which proposed that landowners will have to give a notice in writing three months before revising rent. It advocated appointing a district collector as rent authority and heavy penalty on tenants for overstaying.
Last month, the Union Cabinet approved this ARHC scheme, under which existing vacant government-funded housing complexes will be converted into Affordable Rental Housing Complexes through ""concession agreements"" for 25 years. ARHC is a sub-scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban.
The concessionaire will make the complexes livable by repair or retrofit and maintenance of rooms and filling up infrastructure gaps such as water, sewer, sanitation, road and related work.
Earlier, PHDCCI President D K Aggarwal demanded reduction in stamp duty and GST as well as infrastructure status for the entire real estate industry. He also suggested to increase the size of stress fund to Rs 1 lakh crore from the current Rs 25,000 crore.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-400-million-poor-now-have-access-to-banks-due-to-pradhan-mantri-jan-dhan-yojana-finance-ministry/story-V7ZTGA4VES6PqUIbG8kAOJ.html,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/housing-ministry-advises-states-to-reduce-stamp-duty-on-property-transactions/articleshow/77802646.cms
7754742,0,0,US Election 2020: Donald Trump accepts Republican Partys re-nomination as presidential candidate,Daily briefing: Govt blames Covid but GST payment stalled year ago ; Sonia sends a message to Congress dissenters,"US President Donald Trump has officially accepted the re-nomination of the Republican Party as its presidential candidate for the November elections, telling his fellow Americans that at no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas.
Trump, 74, in his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House amidst cheers from his supporters on Thursday night, said: My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States.
I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years, Trump said.
In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity! he said.
Party's delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
Pence delivered his acceptance speech from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday. This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Addressing an audience of about 1,500 invited guests, Trump said that the Republican Party goes forward united, determined and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
Trump and Pence are being challenged by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin senator Kamala Harris.
Harris, 55, has scripted history by becoming the first African-American and Indian-origin person to be nominated as a vice presidential candidate by a major political party.
As per an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days from now is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump's acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party, which gathers once in four years in one of the American cities to nominate its presidential candidate.
This year it was scheduled to be held in Charlotte in North Carolina. Due to the restrictions on social gatherings as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the convention went into a virtual mode, with only essential official business being held in Charlotte.
Popular Indian-American politician Nikki Haley was the star speaker on Monday, the first day. First Lady Melania Trump addressed the convention from Rose Garden of the White House on Tuesday, while Pence delivered his acceptance speech on Wednesday.
Trump's daughter Ivanka, who is also his presidential advisor, addressed the convention before him on Thursday night.
He's our commander-in-chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. He is our president, and my father, Donald J Trump, Ivanka said.
His son Donald Trump Jr addressed the convention on Monday, while daughter Tiffney and other son Eric addressed the convention on Tuesday and daughter-in-law Lara on Wednesday. A group of protesters had gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House in advance of Trump's speech.
Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, and his wife were among the special invitees on the South Lawns of the White House for Trump's acceptance speech. Al Mason said it was amazing spectacular and full of enthusiasm never seen in the Democratic convention last week.","August 28, 2020: A look at the top news today.Good morning Readers,
We are covering the Supreme Courts decision to sub-classify the list of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Congress leader Sonia Gandhis snub to party dissenters in both Houses of Parliament and why the delay on GST compensation payments cannot be blamed on Covid.
The Big Story
In a move that is likely to further deepen the faultlines between the Centre and States over GST Compensation, the latter were presented with two options to make up the revenue shortfall, and both involve borrowing from the RBI. 
Like the IE top edit says, “shifting the burden on to the states is tantamount to the Centre reneging on its promise of protecting their revenues.”
And what’s more, the Centre chose to pin much of the blame for the delays on payments to the slowdown inflicted by the pandemic, but the delayspreceded the Covid-19 shock by almost a year.
From The Front Page
The Supreme Court has allowed states to sub-classify the list of  SCs, STs, and SEBCs. “When the reservation creates inequalities within the reserved castes itself, it is required to be taken care of by the State,” it said. Meanwhile, in poll-bound Bihar, the JD(U) seemed enthused by the court order, whilethe BJP seemed more wary.
It was only days ago that Congress president Sonia Gandhi said “lets move ahead what has happened has happened” over a letter written by the 23 dissenters, but the matter doesn’t seem to be over just yet as they weresnubbed in both Houses of Parliament.
New Delhi is considering sending External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to Russia next month, around September 9-11, where he will have a chance to meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and discuss steps to resolve the border crisis, The Indian Express has learnt.
The Pandemic

With nine out of a 59-member Andamanese tribe testing positive for Covid-19, including four in a remote island, authorities have now expressed the need to keep the group isolated from the settlers and subsequently minimise the dangers for the remaining tribes. 
Ten lakh masks, 10 lakh pairs of gloves, 1,300 infrared thermometer guns and 6,600 litres of hand sanitiser, among other items all at an additional cost of almost Rs 13 crore   will be used across 660 test sites for JEE (Main), the first national-level entrance examination since the Covid outbreak.

Those who made it out of Tarique Gardens in Maharashtra’s Mahad before it came crashing down on Monday say it was Naveed Duste who had raised an alarm when he saw the five-storey structure was about to give way. The electrician, who does not live in the area but happened to simply pass by then, now lies in the ICU with his leg amputated.

Japans SkyDrive Inc., among the myriads of flying car projects around the world, has carried out a successful though modest test flight with one person aboard. (©SkyDrive/CARTIVATOR 2020 via AP)The decades-old dream of zipping around in the sky as simply as driving on highways may be becoming less illusory.
Japan’s SkyDrive Inc., among the myriads of “flying car” projects around the world, has carried out a successful though modest test flight with one person aboard.
In a video shown to reporters on Friday, a contraption that looked like a slick motorcycle with propellers lifted several feet (1-2 meters) off the ground, and hovered in a netted area for four minutes.
Tomohiro Fukuzawa, who heads the SkyDrive effort, said he hopes “the flying car” can be made into a real-life product by 2023, but he acknowledged that making it safe was critical.

Japans SkyDrive Inc., among the myriads of flying car projects around the world, has carried out a successful though modest test flight with one person aboard. (©SkyDrive/CARTIVATOR 2020 via AP)“Of the world’s more than 100 flying car projects, only a handful has succeeded with a person on board,” he told The Associated Press.
“I hope many people will want to ride it and feel safe.” The machine so far can fly for just five to 10 minutes but if that can become 30 minutes, it will have more potential, including exports to places like China, Fukuzawa said.
Unlike airplanes and helicopters, eVTOL, or electric vertical takeoff and landing, vehicles offer quick point-to-point personal travel, at least in principle.
They could do away with the hassle of airports and traffic jams and the cost of hiring pilots, they could fly automatically.
Battery sizes, air traffic control and other infrastructure issues are among the many potential challenges to commercializing them.
 (©SkyDrive/CARTIVATOR 2020 via AP)“Many things have to happen,” said Sanjiv Singh, professor at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, who co-founded Near Earth Autonomy, near Pittsburgh, which is also working on an eVTOL aircraft.
“If they cost $10 million, no one is going to buy them. If they fly for 5 minutes, no one is going to buy them. If they fall out of the sky every so often, no one is going to buy them,” Singh said in a telephone interview.
The SkyDrive project began humbly as a volunteer project called Cartivator in 2012, with funding by top Japanese companies including automaker Toyota Motor Corp., electronics company Panasonic Corp. and video-game developer Bandai Namco.
A demonstration flight three years ago went poorly. But it has improved and the project recently received another round of funding, of 3.9 billion yen ($37 million), including from the Development Bank of Japan.
The Japanese government is bullish on “the Jetsons” vision, with a “road map” for business services by 2023, and expanded commercial use by the 2030s, stressing its potential for connecting remote areas and providing lifelines in disasters.
Experts compare the buzz over flying cars to the days when the aviation industry got started with the Wright Brothers and the auto industry with the Ford Model T.
Lilium of Germany, Joby Aviation in California and Wisk, a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Kitty Hawk Corp., are also working on eVTOL projects.
Sebastian Thrun, chief executive of Kitty Hawk, said it took time for airplanes, cell phones and self-driving cars to win acceptance.
“But the time between technology and social adoption might be more compressed for eVTOL vehicles,” he said.

For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App.",", (Reuters) - Japan’s Shinzo Abe swept back for a rare second stint as prime minister in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values. 
Abe became Japan’s longest-serving premier in November 2019. But by the summer of 2020, public support had been eroded by his handling of the COVID-19 outbreak as well as a series of scandals including the arrest of his former justice minister. 
On Friday, a person familiar with the matter said he had decided to resign, news that followed days of speculation about his health. Public broadcaster NHK earlier said Abe wanted to avoid causing problems for the government due to his worsening condition. 
Abe first took office in 2006 as Japan’s youngest prime minister since World War Two. After a year plagued by political scandals, voter outrage at lost pension records, and an election drubbing for his ruling party, Abe quit citing ill health. 
“What worries me most now is that because of my resigning, the conservative ideals that the Abe administration raised will fade,” Abe subsequently wrote in the magazine Bungei Shunju. 
“From now on, I want to sacrifice myself as one lawmaker to make true conservatism take root in Japan.” 
Five years after resigning, which he blamed on the intestinal ailment ulcerative colitis, Abe led his conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) - ousted in 2009 - back to power. 
He then launched a three-pronged “Abenomics” strategy to beat persistent deflation and revive economic growth with hyper-easy monetary policy and fiscal spending, along with structural reform to cope with a fast-aging, shrinking population. 
Deflation proved stubborn, however, and his growth strategy suffered in 2019 from a sales tax hike and Sino-U.S. trade war. The COVID-19 outbreak the following year triggered Japan’s biggest-ever economic slump. 
At the outbreak’s onset, Abe was slow to close Japan’s borders and implement a state of emergency urging people to stay home and shops to close. Critics initially branded the response clumsy and later faulted Abe for a lack of leadership. 
Still, Japan’s death rate remained far below that of many other developed nations. 
DYNASTY 
Abe hailed from a wealthy political family that included a foreign minister father and a great-uncle who served as premier. But when it came to many policies, his grandfather, the late prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, seems to have mattered most. 
Kishi was a wartime cabinet minister imprisoned but never tried as a war criminal after World War Two. He served as prime minister from 1957 to 1960, resigning due to public furore over a renegotiated U.S.-Japan security pact. 
Five years old at the time, Abe famously heard the sound of clashes between police and leftist crowds protesting the pact outside parliament as he played on his grandfather’s lap. 
Kishi tried unsuccessfully to revise Japan’s U.S.-drafted 1947 constitution to become an equal security partner with the United States and adopt a more assertive diplomacy - issues central to Abe’s own agenda. 
Abe boosted defence spending and reached out to other Asian countries to counter China’s growing clout. He also pushed the passage of laws to let Japan exercise the right of “collective self-defence”, or militarily aiding an ally under attack. 
Revising the pacifist constitution remained a top priority for Abe, a contentious goal since many Japanese see the charter as responsible for the country’s post-war record of peace. 
Abe’s underlying agenda was to escape what he called the post-war regime, a legacy of U.S. occupation that conservatives argue deprived Japan of national pride. Reforming the education system to restore traditional mores was another of his goals. 
TOUGH STANCE 
First elected to parliament in 1993 after his father’s death, Abe rose to national fame by adopting a tough stance toward unpredictable neighbour North Korea in a feud over Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang decades ago. 
Though Abe also sought to improve ties with China and South Korea, where bitter wartime memories run deep, he riled both neighbours in 2013 by visiting Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, seen by Beijing and Seoul as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism. 
In later years, he refrained from visiting in person and instead sent ritual offerings. 
Across the Pacific, Abe forged close ties with U.S. President Donald Trump, playing golf and engaging in frequent phone calls and meetings. 
He was reelected as LDP president for a third consecutive three-year-term in 2018 after a party rule change and, until the COVID-19 pandemic struck, some in the LDP had considered another rule change to allow him a fourth term.

Samba-Panza, 64, who became the first woman to lead the country of 4.6 million in the wake of a political crisis in 2012-2013, said on Friday that she took the decision after many people had encouraged her to run. 
“In the face of increased socio-political tension and the degrading security in the country, many appealed from all sides of the political spectrum, asking me to run,” Samba-Panza said in a speech to supporters in the capital. 
“I have proven that I wasn’t infected by the virus of power by keeping the constitutional commitment not to run in 2016,” she said. 
Touadera, who was elected in 2016, is expected to seek a second term in the election but has not yet confirmed he will run. 
Deposed former president Francois Bozize who was overthrown in a 2013 rebellion by a coalition of mainly Muslim rebels from the north, plunging the majority Christian nation into a violent civil war, has announced he will be running in the December election. 
Stability remains fragile in the country despite the presence of over 12,000 United Nations peacekeepers, and the signing of peace deals between armed groups.

Yevmenov emphasized that the war games are part of Russia's efforts to boost its presence in the Arctic region and protect its resources. (Representational/Vadim Savitsky/Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP, file)The Russian navy conducted major war games near Alaska involving dozens of ships and aircraft, the military said Friday, the biggest such drills in the area since Soviet times.
Russia’s navy chief, Adm Nikolai Yevmenov, said that more than 50 warships and about 40 aircraft were taking part in the exercise in the Bering Sea, which involved multiple practice missile launches. “We are holding such massive drills there for the first time ever,” Yevmenov said in a statement released by the Russian Defense Ministry.
It wasn’t immediately clear when the exercises began or if they had finished. Yevmenov emphasized that the war games are part of Russia’s efforts to boost its presence in the Arctic region and protect its resources. “We are building up our forces to ensure the economic development of the region,” he said. “We are getting used to the Arctic spaces.”
The Russian military has rebuilt and expanded numerous facilities across the polar region in recent years, revamping runways and deploying additional air defense assets. Russia has prioritised boosting its military presence in the Arctic region, which is believed to hold up to one-quarter of the Earth’s undiscovered oil and gas.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has cited estimates that put the value of Arctic mineral riches at USD 30 trillion. Russia’s Pacific Fleet, whose assets were taking part in the maneuvers, said the Omsk nuclear submarine and the Varyag missile cruiser launched cruise missiles at a practice target in the Bering Sea as part of the exercise.
The maneuvers also saw Onyx cruise missiles being fired at a practice target in the Gulf of Anadyr from the coast of the Chukchi Peninsula, it added. As the exercise was ongoing, US military monitored a Russian submarine surfacing near Alaska on Thursday. US Northern Command spokesman Bill Lewis noted that the Russian military exercise is taking place in international waters, well outside US territory.
The presence of Russian military assets in the area caused a stir for US commercial fishing vessels in the Bering Sea on Wednesday. “We were notified by multiple fishing vessels that were operating out the Bering Sea that they had come across these vessels and were concerned,” US Coast Guard spokesman Kip Wadlow said Thursday.
The Coast Guard contacted the Alaskan Command at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, which confirmed the ships were there as part of a pre-planned Russian military exercise that was known to some US military officials, he said. The Russian military has expanded the number and the scope of its war games in recent years as Russia-West relations have sunk to their lowest level since the Cold War after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, and other crises.

4745059,0,0,NBA star LeBron James emerges as potent political force ahead of November U.S. election,US Election 2020: Donald Trump accepts Republican Partys re-nomination as presidential candidate,"(Reuters) - Two years after a conservative commentator told LeBron James to “shut up and dribble,” the NBA star has become an increasingly influential political force as issues of racial justice and voter suppression move to the forefront in the November presidential election. 
James, an outspoken activist and frequent critic of President Donald Trump, helped form a group that will spend millions of dollars to battle voter disenfranchisement in predominantly Black communities ahead of the Nov. 3 election between the Republican Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. 
He also has helped push the NBA to recognize racial justice issues and the Black Lives Matter movement, including the decision to postpone playoff games this week after a player boycott to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by police in Wisconsin. 
That prompted Trump to denounce the league on Thursday, saying it was “like a political organization.” 
James, who campaigned for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016, has promised to campaign for Biden this year. His influence could be critical in 2020, strategists and activists said, given the party’s need to bolster Black voter turnout, which saw its first drop in 20 years in 2016. 
“LeBron is likely to have a huge impact,” said Karen Finney, a Democratic political strategist and aide on Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “He has the respect and the credibility with the Black community, so he’s a tremendous asset.” 
James’ longtime activism on racial justice issues and criticism of Trump prompted white Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham in 2018 to tell him and fellow Black NBA star Kevin Durant to “shut up and dribble.” 
This week, James, 35, a 16-time NBA All Star who is considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time, reacted angrily to the shooting on Sunday of Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which sparked days of civil unrest. 
The incident recalled the police killing of another Black man, George Floyd, in Minnesota in May that sparked anti-racism demonstrations in many U.S. cities. Blake’s shooting reverberated through U.S. professional sports, with leagues postponing games and practices. 
“WE DEMAND CHANGE. SICK OF IT,” tweeted James, whose Los Angeles Lakers are vying for the National Basketball Association title. 
James’ leadership on the issue got the attention of the White House, with adviser Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, saying in a televised interview on Thursday that he would reach out to James to see what both sides could work on together. 
Biden said on Thursday he was arranging a call with the NBA after it reached out to discuss the boycotts. He did not elaborate, and a spokesman for his campaign declined to do so as well. 
TRUSTED VOICES 
James formed the voting rights group More Than a Vote earlier this year along with other prominent athletes to counter misinformation and fight what he said was voter suppression in Black communities. 
“LeBron recognized that these athletes are the most trusted members of their communities,” said a person familiar with his thinking. “It is entirely about the Black community and protecting and strengthening their right to vote.” 
The group will collaborate with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund on a multimillion-dollar initiative to recruit young poll workers in Black communities in a dozen states, including battlegrounds such as Michigan, Florida, Wisconsin and Georgia. 
A shortage of poll workers to staff in-person voting sites amid worries about the coronavirus pandemic led to dramatically fewer polling locations in some states that held primaries earlier this year, including Georgia and Wisconsin. 
That led to long lines, hours-long waits and widespread confusion, particularly in hard-hit African-American communities that felt the brunt of the cutbacks. 
The group previously partnered with teams in Los Angeles and Atlanta to turn stadiums into polling places, and worked on an effort to help the formerly incarcerated restore their voting rights in Florida. 
Amy Koch, a Republican strategist who lives in Minneapolis, where Floyd’s death sparked the first wave of protests, said James’ voice would have an impact but carried some risk of alienating suburban voters who have grown frustrated and are not differentiating between peaceful protests and violent ones. 
“If he can get some of that extra vote out, he will make a difference,” she said. “The difference between him and some other celebrities is he doesn’t wade into everything, so he has credibility and he’s disciplined.” 
Donna Brazile, a former Democratic National Committee chairwoman and the campaign manager for presidential candidate Al Gore in 2000, said James and other athletes were using their celebrity to draw attention to the inequities of the justice system. 
“What they’re saying to their fan base is if you want change, you’re going to have to vote for change,” she said. “If you want to fix the problem, you’re going to have to put people in office who can change the policies.”

Trump, 74, in his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House amidst cheers from his supporters on Thursday night, said: My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States.
I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years, Trump said.
In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity! he said.
Party's delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
Pence delivered his acceptance speech from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday. This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Addressing an audience of about 1,500 invited guests, Trump said that the Republican Party goes forward united, determined and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
Trump and Pence are being challenged by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin senator Kamala Harris.
Harris, 55, has scripted history by becoming the first African-American and Indian-origin person to be nominated as a vice presidential candidate by a major political party.
As per an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days from now is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump's acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party, which gathers once in four years in one of the American cities to nominate its presidential candidate.
This year it was scheduled to be held in Charlotte in North Carolina. Due to the restrictions on social gatherings as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the convention went into a virtual mode, with only essential official business being held in Charlotte.
Popular Indian-American politician Nikki Haley was the star speaker on Monday, the first day. First Lady Melania Trump addressed the convention from Rose Garden of the White House on Tuesday, while Pence delivered his acceptance speech on Wednesday.
Trump's daughter Ivanka, who is also his presidential advisor, addressed the convention before him on Thursday night.
He's our commander-in-chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. He is our president, and my father, Donald J Trump, Ivanka said.
His son Donald Trump Jr addressed the convention on Monday, while daughter Tiffney and other son Eric addressed the convention on Tuesday and daughter-in-law Lara on Wednesday. A group of protesters had gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House in advance of Trump's speech.
Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, and his wife were among the special invitees on the South Lawns of the White House for Trump's acceptance speech.

6635268,0,0,"Japan's Shinzo Abe sought to revive economy, fulfil conservative agenda","Jan Dhan scheme completes six years, benefits 40.35 crore people",", (Reuters) - Japan’s Shinzo Abe swept back for a rare second stint as prime minister in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values. 
Abe became Japan’s longest-serving premier in November 2019. But by the summer of 2020, public support had been eroded by his handling of the COVID-19 outbreak as well as a series of scandals including the arrest of his former justice minister. 
On Friday, a person familiar with the matter said he had decided to resign, news that followed days of speculation about his health. Public broadcaster NHK earlier said Abe wanted to avoid causing problems for the government due to his worsening condition. 
Abe first took office in 2006 as Japan’s youngest prime minister since World War Two. After a year plagued by political scandals, voter outrage at lost pension records, and an election drubbing for his ruling party, Abe quit citing ill health. 
“What worries me most now is that because of my resigning, the conservative ideals that the Abe administration raised will fade,” Abe subsequently wrote in the magazine Bungei Shunju. 
“From now on, I want to sacrifice myself as one lawmaker to make true conservatism take root in Japan.” 
Five years after resigning, which he blamed on the intestinal ailment ulcerative colitis, Abe led his conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) - ousted in 2009 - back to power. 
He then launched a three-pronged “Abenomics” strategy to beat persistent deflation and revive economic growth with hyper-easy monetary policy and fiscal spending, along with structural reform to cope with a fast-aging, shrinking population. 
Deflation proved stubborn, however, and his growth strategy suffered in 2019 from a sales tax hike and Sino-U.S. trade war. The COVID-19 outbreak the following year triggered Japan’s biggest-ever economic slump. 
At the outbreak’s onset, Abe was slow to close Japan’s borders and implement a state of emergency urging people to stay home and shops to close. Critics initially branded the response clumsy and later faulted Abe for a lack of leadership. 
Still, Japan’s death rate remained far below that of many other developed nations. 
DYNASTY 
Abe hailed from a wealthy political family that included a foreign minister father and a great-uncle who served as premier. But when it came to many policies, his grandfather, the late prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, seems to have mattered most. 
Kishi was a wartime cabinet minister imprisoned but never tried as a war criminal after World War Two. He served as prime minister from 1957 to 1960, resigning due to public furore over a renegotiated U.S.-Japan security pact. 
Five years old at the time, Abe famously heard the sound of clashes between police and leftist crowds protesting the pact outside parliament as he played on his grandfather’s lap. 
Kishi tried unsuccessfully to revise Japan’s U.S.-drafted 1947 constitution to become an equal security partner with the United States and adopt a more assertive diplomacy - issues central to Abe’s own agenda. 
Abe boosted defence spending and reached out to other Asian countries to counter China’s growing clout. He also pushed the passage of laws to let Japan exercise the right of “collective self-defence”, or militarily aiding an ally under attack. 
Revising the pacifist constitution remained a top priority for Abe, a contentious goal since many Japanese see the charter as responsible for the country’s post-war record of peace. 
Abe’s underlying agenda was to escape what he called the post-war regime, a legacy of U.S. occupation that conservatives argue deprived Japan of national pride. Reforming the education system to restore traditional mores was another of his goals. 
TOUGH STANCE 
First elected to parliament in 1993 after his father’s death, Abe rose to national fame by adopting a tough stance toward unpredictable neighbour North Korea in a feud over Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang decades ago. 
Though Abe also sought to improve ties with China and South Korea, where bitter wartime memories run deep, he riled both neighbours in 2013 by visiting Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, seen by Beijing and Seoul as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism. 
In later years, he refrained from visiting in person and instead sent ritual offerings. 
Across the Pacific, Abe forged close ties with U.S. President Donald Trump, playing golf and engaging in frequent phone calls and meetings. 
He was reelected as LDP president for a third consecutive three-year-term in 2018 after a party rule change and, until the COVID-19 pandemic struck, some in the LDP had considered another rule change to allow him a fourth term. 
Reporting by Linda Sieg; Editing by Christopher Cushing","More than 40.35 crore people benefited from the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) which was launched six years ago as a national mission for financial inclusion, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Friday.
The Jan Dhan Yojana, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day address in 2014, was launched on August 28, in the same year.
""The PMJDY has been the foundation stone for the Modi government's people-centric economic initiatives.
""Whether it is direct benefit transfers, COVID-19 financial assistance, PM-KISAN, increased wages under MGNREGA, life and health insurance cover, the first step was to provide every adult with a bank account, which PMJDY has nearly completed,"" Sitharaman said on the sixth anniversary of the scheme.
Financial Inclusion is a national priority of the government as it is an enabler for inclusive growth, the finance ministry statement said.
It is important as it provides an avenue to the poor for bringing their savings into the formal financial system, an avenue to remit money to their families in villages besides taking them out of the clutches of the usurious money lenders, it said.
Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, PMJDY has brought the unbanked into the banking system, expanded the financial architecture of India and brought financial inclusion to over 40 crore account holders and a majority of the beneficiaries are women and most of the accounts are from rural India.
""In today's COVID-19 times, we have witnessed the remarkable swiftness and seamlessness with which Direct Benefit Transfer (DBTs) have empowered and provided financial security to the vulnerable sections of society.
""An important aspect is that DBTs via PM Jan Dhan accounts have ensured every rupee reaches its intended beneficiary and prevented systemic leakage,"" he said.
Total deposit balances under PMJDY Accounts was at Rs 1.31 lakh crore and average deposit per account stood at Rs 3,239.
PMJDY is national mission for financial inclusion to ensure access to financial services, namely, savings and deposit accounts, remittance, credit, insurance, pension in an affordable manner.
In 2018, the government launched PMJDY 2.0 with enhanced features and benefits.
Under the new version, the government decided to shift focus from 'Every Household' to 'Every Unbanked Adult' and free accidental insurance cover on RuPay cards doubled to Rs 2 lakh for PMJDY accounts opened after August 28, 2018.
At the same time Overdraft (OD) limit too doubled to Rs 10,000 and facility of OD up to Rs 2,000 without conditions was brought in.
In the last one-year period, nearly 3.6 crore Jan Dhan account were opened leading the aggregate number to 40.35 crore as on August 19, 2020.
As per extant RBI guidelines, a PMJDY account is treated as inoperative if there are no customer induced transactions in the account for over a period of two years.
In August, 2020, out of total 40.35 crore PMJDY accounts, 34.81 crore or 86.3 per cent were operative, it said.
The finance ministry said the endeavour is to ensure coverage of PMJDY account holders under micro insurance schemes and improving access of PMJDY account holders to micro-credit and micro-investment such as flexi-recurring deposit etc.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-politics-abe-newsmaker-idUSKBN25O0KM,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/jan-dhan-scheme-completes-six-years-benefits-40-35-crore-people-5766601.html
6924962,0,0,What if Facebook is the real ‘silent majority’? An eye-opener for those who think Trump will lose,Covid-19: What you need to know today - Hindustan Times,"By Kevin RooseListen, liberals. If you dont think Donald Trump can get reelected in November, you need to spend more time on Facebook.
Since the 2016 election, Ive been obsessively tracking how partisan political content is performing on Facebook, the worlds largest and arguably most influential media platform. Every morning, one of the first browser tabs I open is CrowdTangle a handy Facebook-owned data tool that offers a birds-eye view of whats popular on the platform. I check which politicians and pundits are going viral. I geek out on trending topics. I browse the previous days stories to see which got the most reactions, shares and comments.
Most days, the leader board looks roughly the same: conservative post after conservative post, with the occasional liberal interloper. (If you want to see these lists for yourselves, you can check out @FacebooksTop10, a Twitter account I created that shows the top 10 most-interacted-with link posts by U.S. Facebook pages every day.)
Its no secret that, despite Trumps claims of Silicon Valley censorship, Facebook has been a boon to him and his allies, and hyperpartisan Facebook pages are nothing new. (In fact, my colleague John Herrman wrote about them four years ago this month.)
But what sticks out, when you dig in to the data, is just how dominant the Facebook right truly is. Pro-Trump political influencers have spent years building a well-oiled media machine that swarms around every major news story, creating a torrent of viral commentary that reliably drowns out both the mainstream media and the liberal opposition.
The result is a kind of parallel media universe that left-of-center Facebook users may never encounter, but that has been stunningly effective in shaping its own version of reality. Inside the right-wing Facebook bubble, Trumps response to COVID-19 has been strong and effective, Joe Biden is barely capable of forming sentences, and Black Lives Matter is a dangerous group of violent looters.
Trump and his supporters are betting that, despite being behind Biden in the polls, a silent majority will carry him to reelection. Donald Trump Jr., the presidents oldest and most online son, made that argument himself at the Republican National Convention this week. And while Im not a political analyst, I know enough about the modern media landscape to know that looking at peoples revealed preferences what they actually read, watch, and click on when nobodys looking is often a better indicator of how theyll act than interviewing them at diners, or listening to what theyre willing to say out loud to a pollster.
Maybe Trumps silent majority, in other words, only seems silent because were not looking at their Facebook feeds.
We live in two different countries right now, said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist and digital director of Marco Rubios 2016 campaign. Facebooks media ecosystem, he said, is a huge blind spot for people who are up to speed on whats on the front page of The New York Times and whats leading the hour on CNN.
To be sure, Facebook is not the only medium where right-wing content thrives. Millions of Americans still get their news from cable news and talk radio, where conservative voices have dominated for years. Many pro-Trump Facebook influencers also have sizable presences on Twitter, YouTube and other social networks.
But the rights dominance on Facebook, specifically, is something to behold.
Here are just a few data points I pulled from CrowdTangle this week:
The conservative commentator Ben Shapiro has gotten 56 million total interactions on his Facebook page in the last 30 days. Thats more than the main pages of ABC News, NBC News, The New York Times, The Washington Post and NPR combined. (Data from a different firm, NewsWhip, showed that Shapiros news outlet, The Daily Wire, was the No. 1 publisher on Facebook in July.)
Facebook posts by Breitbart, the far-right news outlet, have been shared 4 million times in the past 30 days, roughly three times as many as posts from the official pages of every Democratic member of the U.S. Senate combined.
The most-shared Facebook post containing the term Black Lives Matter over the past six months is a June video by the right-wing commentators The Hodgetwins, which calls the racial justice movement a damn lie. The second most-shared Black Lives Matter post? A different viral video from The Hodgetwins, this one calling the movement a leftist lie. (The Hodgetwins also have the 4th, 6th, and 12th most shared posts.)
Terrence K. Williams, a conservative comedian and Trump supporter, has averaged 86,500 interactions per Facebook post in August, more than twice as many as Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, who has averaged 39,000 interactions per post. (Trump outdoes them both, naturally, with an average of 92,000 interactions per post.)
A few caveats, before my Democratic readers jump off the nearest pier.
These figures include only posts on public pages, in public groups, and by verified accounts, and they dont include Facebook ads, where the Biden campaign has been outspending the Trump campaign in recent weeks. Counting Facebook interactions doesnt tell you how someone felt about a post, so its possible some conservative posts are being hate-shared by liberals. And Facebook has argued that engagement isnt the same thing as popularity.
These points look mostly at how people engage with content, which should not be confused with how many people actually see it on Facebook, Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. Osborne added that when you look at the content that gets the most reach across Facebook, its not at all as partisan as this reporting suggests. (Facebook does not disclose this type of data publicly, except once in a while in response to my tweets.)
Democrats arent totally absent from Facebooks upper echelon. Ridin With Biden, a pro-Biden page started in April by the founders of the liberal Facebook page Occupy Democrats, has quadrupled its following over the past three months, and routinely gets more engagement than Breitbart and other right-wing heavy-hitters. Individual posts by Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama and other prominent Democrats have broken through in recent weeks.
And political campaigners have pointed out, correctly, that being popular on the internet isnt a guarantee of electoral success. (Retweets dont vote, as an experienced Democratic operative once told me.) In addition, Facebooks older, more conservative user base may not reflect whats happening on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, which draw a younger crowd.
Still, the platforms sheer scale makes it vital to understand. As of 2019, 70% of American adults used Facebook, and 43% of Americans got news on the platform, according to the Pew Research Center. (Those numbers may have increased because of the pandemic.) We know that the companys product decisions can make or break political movements, move fringe ideas into the mainstream, or amplify partisan polarization. Registering 4 million voters before the November election, as Facebook has said it would do, could be a decisive force all on its own. (Typically, higher turnout benefits Democrats, but given what we know about the media diets of hyperactive Facebook users, who knows?)
The reason right-wing content performs so well on Facebook is no mystery. The platform is designed to amplify emotionally resonant posts, and conservative commentators are skilled at turning passionate grievances into powerful algorithm fodder. The company also appears willing to bend its rules for popular conservative influencers. A recent report by NBC News, citing a leaked internal report, found that Facebook executives had removed strikes from the accounts of several high-profile conservative pages that had shared viral misinformation in violation of the companys rules.
Over the past few years, Ive come to view my daily Facebook data-dive as a kind of early-warning system a rough gauge of whats grabbing Americas attention on any given day, and which stories and perspectives will likely break through in the days to come.
And looking at Facebooks lopsided political media ecosystem might be a useful reality check for Democrats who think Biden will coast to victory in November.
After all, Trumps surging popularity showed up online before it showed up in any polls in 2016. And even though much about Facebook, and American politics, has changed in the past four years, the basic laws of social media physics still apply. Controversy wins. Negative beats positive. All attention looks good to an algorithm.
Brad Parscale the digital director of Trumps 2016 campaign told 60 Minutes that of everything Trump did that year, the thing that actually moved the needle was Facebook.
Facebook was the method, Parscale said. It was the highway which his car drove on.
That highway is still open. And right now, the fastest cars on it have MAGA bumper stickers.","Scientists have found the answers (or the beginning of answers) to two important questions about Covid-19.
The first: why are men who contract the coronavirus disease at greater risk than women?
The answer — like many others where Covid-19 is concerned — lies in the immune response to the virus.
According to research by Akiko Iwasaki and others at the Yale School of Medicine, the male immune response is largely built around cytokines and chemokines, both signalling proteins that are part of the body’s immune response. The female response, the research, published in Nature says, is driven by T-cells, a major (and stronger) component of the immune system. The research offers the first plausible answer on why the mortality rate among infected men, especially those over the age of 60, is higher than that among infected women. As an aside, those interested in the more scientific aspects of Covid-19 would do well to follow Iwasaki’s work — she is among the clearest thinkers on many aspects of the disease.
The second question: can someone cured of Covid-19 be re-infected?
There have been many false starts to this answer, including some local ones, but according to a paper published on August 25 in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, the answer is yes.
The paper is based on research by doctors and scientists at the University of Hong Kong and speaks of a 33-year old man who recovered from Covid-19 in April, and was re-infected in August. The viral genome from the first and the second infections were sequenced, studied and, found to be genetically distinct. This wasn’t simply a residual infection — it was a new one. Interestingly, the second time the man was infected, he remained asymptomatic, and his immune system kicked in, producing new antibodies.
HT reported the Hong Kong incident soon after it happened, but there is a larger (and a related) learning in the two studies for vaccine developers. The first study (the one on gender differences) shows that they will have to factor in gender while developing vaccines to ensure that these are effective across the population. The second study shows that being infected once does not always rule out a re-infection — more research is needed, but, in general, it still could in many cases. This isn’t necessarily a blow for administrators and health care workers in regions hit hard by Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease, who were hoping that the high prevalence of the disease, as measured by antibody surveys, bestowed some level of immunity on the population. That could still be the case — but it cannot be taken for granted. Typically, this is also one of the things vaccines are tested for — not just whether they can provoke an immune response against the disease, but whether they can prevent a re-infection.
The need to answer questions such as these is why vaccine development usually takes years. The global health and economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has meant that vaccine developers have tried to shorten the development cycle — something that could have a bearing on the efficacy of the vaccines or the length of the protection they offer (but that’s another story).
Nature’s website recently published a telling story (and graphic) on the extent to which the world is counting on the vaccines under development. Based on data from Airfinity, a research firm, the article said countries have struck deals or announced commitments for almost 4.5 billion doses of vaccines from nine vaccine developers. The UK, the article points out, has committed to buying 340 million doses. Its population is a little less than 70 million. The US, the European Union, and Japan have also committed to buying enough to vaccinate every one of their residents at least once, according to the article. India recently set up a committee to discuss various aspects of its vaccine strategy, from funding and sourcing to storage and delivery, but the global rush for vaccines only highlights the need to finalise this soon.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/what-if-facebook-is-the-real-silent-majority-an-eye-opener-for-those-who-think-trump-will-lose/articleshow/77798040.cms,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-ZDV2fyGqjf5R54NuJqntAL.html
1206432,0,0,"Hong Kong lifts Brazil's Aurora chicken plant ban, meat lobby says - Reuters","Energy export severely disrupted by Hurricane Laura, 1 bpd reduction likely","SAO PAULO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s government has lifted a temporary ban on chicken imports from a plant operated by Brazil’s Central Cooperativa Aurora that was blocked until tests proved there was no risk of contamination by coronavirus in meat produced there. 
According to a statement from Brazilian meat industry lobby ABPA, the ban was lifted on Friday by Hong Kong’s food safety and health authorities after the Brazilian government provided all assurances that the products are safe. 
Aurora confirmed the lifting of the ban, which concerned its chicken plant in the town of Xaxim, state of Santa Catarina, in southern Brazil. 
Hong Kong suspended chicken imports from that Aurora facility on Aug. 17. The move was announced after the Chinese city of Shenzhen detected the virus’ genetic material on chicken wings and packages originated there. 
That discovery led Aurora, Brazil’s third largest chicken and poultry producer, to voluntarily suspended poultry exports to China from that plant. That self-imposed ban remains in place, an Aurora spokesman said. (Reporting by Ana Mano Editing by Marguerita Choy)","By Scott DiSavino and Jessica Jaganathan
NEW YORK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil and gas exports from the United States have been severely disrupted by Hurricane Laura, with nearly a million barrels per day (bpd) of crude exports likely reduced this week by closures of U.S. Gulf Coast terminals and disruptions at ports.
The hurricane also temporarily suspended operations at several liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities in the world's third largest exporter of the super-cooled gas, with shipments on track to fall to their lowest in 18 months.
Laura made landfall early Thursday near the Texas-Louisiana border, one of the most powerful storms to ever hit the region, and raced north.
Ports of Lake Charles, Beaumont and Port Arthur remained closed on Thursday, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.
The Port of Houston, which is the top U.S. crude oil export hub accounting for about 600,000 bpd of shipments, closed on Wednesday and was in the process of reopening to commercial shipping late Thursday, according to the Coast Guard.
Some 50 vessels, most of them tankers, were at anchorage offshore and waiting to re-enter the Houston Shipping Channel, said JJ Plunkett, port agent for the Houston Pilots Association, which guides vessels in and out of the ship channel.
The closures of Houston Port, Beaumont and Port Arthur were expected to reduce seaborne crude export capacity by nearly 1 million bpd, data intelligence firm Kpler estimated, based on average figures over the past four months.
U.S. crude exports averaged about 2.9 million bpd in the last four weeks, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The closure of those ports would also reduce a total of about 830,000 bpd in refined product departures, Kpler said.
The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), the largest privately-owned crude terminal in the United States, also suspended operations at its marine terminal on Sunday ahead of the storm.
Oil tankers have headed back to major loading points along the Gulf Coast on Friday after taking shelter at Corpus Christi on Thursday, shipping data on Refinitiv Eikon showed.
LNG tankers in and around the Gulf of Mexico start to resume operations https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jbyprqqbwve/LNGTankerFleetUSGulf.png
Two LNG tankers are currently waiting near ports to load cargoes while several others are still off the Caribbean, Kpler's Rebecca Chia said.
The extent of disruption would depend on any damage inflicted on export and production facilities. Energy companies were gearing up to survey the storm's impact on Thursday.

Loadings of LNG cargoes from the United States have also been delayed.
LNG exports were on track to fall to 2.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Thursday, their lowest since February 2019, according to data from Refinitiv.
""Given the direct hit on the Sabine Pass and Cameron LNG export terminals by Hurricane Laura, they will likely be the last terminals to restart exports in the Gulf,"" analysts at ClipperData said in a note, referring to Cheniere Energy Inc's Sabine Pass and Sempra Energy's Cameron LNG export plants in Louisiana.
Both plants suspended operations earlier this week and said they would conduct damage assessments as soon as it was safe to do so.
Separately, Venture Global said on Friday that its Calcasieu Pass LNG facility which is under construction in Cameron, Louisiana, has sustained minimal impacts from the hurricane and that it is working with contractors to regain access to the site.

3820798,0,0,Focus of latest U.S. racial flashpoint shifts to accused Kenosha vigilante,"6 non-BJP states file review petition in Supreme Court for NEET, JEE postponement - Hindustan Times","KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - An accused teenage vigilante facing charges he killed two people protesting in support of Jacob Blake Jr., the Black man shot in the back by a white policeman in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was due to appear in an Illinois courtroom on Friday. 
Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was charged in Wisconsin with six criminal counts including first-degree intentional homicide, attempted homicide, reckless endangerment and possession of a dangerous weapon below the legal age of 18. 
He was scheduled to make his first court appearance in Lake County, Illinois, where he was arrested on Wednesday, for a hearing on a request from Wisconsin authorities to have him extradited from Illinois. 
Adding to the attention surrounding the case, Rittenhouse will be defended by a prominent law firm whose clients have included President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani and former Trump adviser Carter Page. 
Lawyer John Pierce told Reuters on Thursday that he and colleagues at the firm, Pierce Bainbridge, had been retained to represent the teenager and were determined to obtain justice for him. L. Lin Wood, another member of the Rittenhouse’s legal team, told CBS News his client had acted in self-defense. 
“He was not there to create trouble, but he found himself with his life threatened, and he had the right to protect himself,” Wood said. 
Sunday’s police shooting, in which Blake was gunned down and left paralyzed, turned Kenosha, a predominantly white city of about 100,000 residents on Lake Michigan, into the latest flashpoint in a summer of protests in the United States over police brutality and racism. 
The drive for racial justice was ignited on May 25 when George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, died in police custody under the knee of a white officer. 
Rittenhouse, a resident of Antioch, Illinois whose arrest warrant listed his occupation as a lifeguard, is accused of shooting three protesters, two fatally, during demonstrations on Tuesday night in Kenosha. 
Video footage from Tuesday’s incident shows a young, white gunman firing an assault-style rifle at protesters who tried to subdue him, then walking calmly away from the scene, hands in the air - with his rifle slung around his neck - as several police vehicles drive by without stopping him. 
According to the criminal complaint, another video shows Rittenhouse saying, “I just killed somebody,” after shooting one of his alleged victims, 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum, who was gunned down in the parking lot of a used-car dealer. 
TASERS USED 
In Kenosha, three nights of skirmishes between protesters and police following Blake’s shooting gave way on Wednesday and Thursday to peaceful, smaller demonstrations. 
The police officers involved in the incident, including Rusten Sheskey, a seven-year veteran of the police force identified by authorities as having fired all seven shots at Blake from directly behind him, have been placed on leave. 
Blake’s family and protesters have demanded the officers be fired and prosecuted. The investigation has been turned over to the Wisconsin Justice Department, while the U.S. Justice Department has opened a civil rights inquiry. 
The Wisconsin Justice Department said on Friday Sheskey and another officer, Vincent Arenas, made two separate attempts to stop Blake with tasers prior to Sheskey discharging his gun. 
It was the first time the identity of Arenas, an officer in Kenosha since February 2019, was disclosed. The department also identified the third officer on the scene as Brittany Meronek, who joined the Kenosha police force in January this year. 
The exact sequence of events leading to Blake’s shooting remain sketchy. 
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said on Wednesday the confrontation stemmed from a domestic complaint lodged by a girlfriend, and that investigators had recovered a knife from the front floorboard of the car that Blake was leaning into when Sheskey shot him from behind at point-blank range. 
Blake’s lead attorney, civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, said his client had no knife in his possession and did nothing to provoke or threaten police before he was shot. 
Protesters planned a march on Washington on Friday, commemorating the anniversary of the 1963 rally where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. 
The civil strife of recent months has drawn comparisons to the outpouring of anger and civil unrest that flared after King’s assassination in 1968.

The review petitioners stated that the Supreme Court, in its August 17 order, failed to consider the safety and security of students who are slated to appear for NEET and JEE and also failed to take into account the logistical difficulties in conducting the examinations. 
“If the order of August 17, 2020 is not reviewed, then grave and irreparable harm and injury will befall the student community of our country and not only will health, welfare and safety of students appearing for NEET/ JEE stand imperilled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy in these Covid -19 pandemic times,” the petition filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes said. 
The six ministers who have filed the petition are Moloy Ghatak (West Bengal), Dr. Rameshwar Oraon (Jharkhand), Dr. Raghu Sharma (Rajasthan), Amarjeet Bhagat (Chhattisgarh), Balbir Singh Sidhu (Punjab) and Uday Ravindra Samant (Maharashtra).
NEET for students seeking admission to medical and dental courses is scheduled to be held on September 13 and the JEE for those aspiring to join top engineering schools is scheduled to be conducted from September 1 to 6.
A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra had, on August 17, rejected a plea filed in August by 11 NEET/ JEE candidates seeking postponement of the exams until after the Covid-19 crisis has passed.
Justice Mishra, while hearing that case on August 17, had said “life has to go on” despite the outbreak of the viral disease and the court cannot put the career of students in jeopardy by interfering with the decision of the National Testing Agency (NTA) to hold the examinations in September.
“Life has to move on even in Covid times. Covid may continue but postponement of exams is a loss for the country. Are you (petitioners) ready to waste a whole year,” justice Mishra had said.
On July 3, the NTA, the central government body tasked with conducting JEE and NEET, came out with public notices to hold the exams in September.
“The career of students cannot be put in peril. We find no merit in the petition. The petition is dismissed,” the bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, had ordered on August 17.
The review petition filed on Friday stated that the Supreme Court’s order of August 17 failed to consider that the decision to conduct examinations amid the ongoing pandemic increases the vulnerability of the students and their families to the risk of infection.
It was further submitted that the Centre had adequate time to make preparations for safe and successful conduct of the examinations but the intervening months from April to September were characterized by inaction and lethargy.
“Now the Union government has suddenly woken up to realise that their inertia is going to cost lakhs of students their academic year and therefore as a knee jerk reaction, the Union government has haphazardly and hurriedly fixed the dates of examinations,” the petition said. 
Further, the petition also said that students from rural areas and semi-urban areas might be forced to use unsafe modes of transportation to reach examination centres and would thereby expose themselves and everyone else to Covid -19.
Besides, students residing in distant placed will find it it difficult to reach examination centres due to limited availability of transportation services during Covid -19.
“Students in tribal pockets and remote areas will face an unfair hurdle to reach and stay at the examination centres compared to those already residing in urban areas or in the vicinity of exam centres,” the plea said.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-global-race-usa-idUKKBN25O1NI,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-ministers-from-non-bjp-states-file-review-petition-in-supreme-court-for-postponement-of-neet-jee/story-9zNsgnsf3SQ5cVRAV6USOJ.html

Agriculture accounts for near 15 percent of India's USD 2.8 trillion economy and is a source of livelihood for more than half of its 1.3 billion people. Higher interest rates will reduce farm earnings, impacting overall rural incomes which are key to reviving the economy. (Image: Reuters)

3715797,0,0,"Global funds once again opt out of stocks, despite rally, Reuters polls show - Reuters",What's next after Japan PM Shinzo Abe quits? Potential successors?,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - Funds recommended equity holdings be trimmed to the lowest in over four years in August, despite record-breaking gains by world stocks, as the pandemic drags on and new data suggest the nascent economic rebound is stalling, Reuters polls found. 
The August 17-27 poll of 35 fund managers and chief investment officers in the U.S., Europe, Britain and Japan was largely taken before Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced a new policy framework promoting higher inflation to spur economic recovery and job creation on Thursday. 
The Fed’s new strategy sent U.S. Treasury yields higher, which gave a lift to interest rate-sensitive financials and in turn boosted the S&amp;P 500 index to a new record high and pushed the MSCI’s all-country world index to surge past its pre-COVID-19 high reached in February. 
While world stocks have risen as much as nearly 60% since March troughs, the poll showed average recommended exposure for equities in August in the model global portfolio was the lowest since July 2016, down to 43.1% from 43.9% the previous month. 
Overall equity exposure is down 6.6 percentage points from the beginning of the year, down from 49.7% in January. 
“The recent upsurge in stock markets around the world is all noise for us as a health solution is still out of reach. We are more concerned about the recovery story. The risks to the global economy remain, with tens of millions of people still out of work because of the pandemic,” said a global chief investment officer at a large U.S. fund management company. 
“The stock market in the near term may be juiced further on the Fed news. But we doubt whether the Fed would be able to lift inflation despite the new target as it hasn’t been able to do so since 2012. Let’s not forget, the U.S. economy is still in a deep crisis, and the risks are more to the downside as Americans prepare to vote in a contentious Nov. 3 election.” 
Economic recovery was foremost in Powell’s remarks made as part of the Kansas City Fed’s virtual Jackson Hole symposium, in which he outlined an aggressive new strategy that aims to boost employment and allow inflation to run a bit faster for longer than in the past. 
That came as new data suggest the labour market recovery is stalling, while the U.S. economy suffered its sharpest contraction in the second quarter since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
The poll suggested keeping bond allocations - a key gauge of caution - for a model global portfolio at 44.3%, the highest since the survey series started in early 2010, for the third month in a row. 
That defensive outlook of long-term investors does not align with the approach of over 200 equity strategists in a separate Reuters poll this week, who expect stocks to keep rising. But they did say a sombre economic outlook was likely to push stock markets to close the year below their pre-pandemic highs. [EPOLL/WRAP] 
In the latest poll, fund managers with a view on when the current bull run in stocks will end were split. About 43% of respondents, or nine of 21, said it already had. Seven, or 33%, said it has over two years to run. 
“This recent bull market rally has been narrow in respect to sector rotation with the economically-sensitive stocks having lagged whilst uncertainties over the second wave of COVID-19 haunts part of the market,” said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum in London. 
“Nonetheless, central bank policy remains supportive and therefore the equity markets are likely to continue their upward trajectory but with some corrective periods along the way.” 
But responses to a separate question suggested fund managers were still cautious in their approach. 
Asked what is the most likely change to their portfolios, over 85% of the fund managers, or 18 of 21, said they would “roughly maintain the current risk positioning”. Those views were broadly unchanged from the July survey. 
“This crisis is already telling us that it will not be a neat and tidy economic global downturn followed by an equal and opposite neat and tidy upturn, like one might see in a traditional economic cycle,” said Mark Robinson, chief investment officer at Bordier &amp; Cie (UK). 
“There are clearly still many uncertainties related to the virus itself and uncertainty about the scale and shape of the recovery, so some caution is still rightly warranted.” 
Reporting and polling by Rahul Karunakar and Tushar Goenka; editing by Ross Finley, Larry King","TOKYO: The abrupt news that Japan's longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe is set to resign over a worsening health condition, set off a flurry of attention on Friday over the path ahead for the world's third-biggest economy. His resignation announcement, expected Friday evening, will trigger an election in his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to replace him as its president, followed by a vote in parliament to elect a new prime minister.
Abe and his cabinet would continue to run the government until a new premier is elected but could not adopt new policies. The winner of the party election would then hold the post until the end of Abe's LDP term in September 2021. The new party president is virtually assured the premiership, since the party has a majority in parliament's lower house.
Usually, the party must announce the election for its leader a month in advance, and its MPs vote along with grassroots members. In case of a sudden resignation, however, an extraordinary vote must be called ""at the soonest date possible"" with participants narrowed to MPs and representatives of the party's local chapters.
Here are details of some likely contenders to take the helm:TARO ASOFinance minister Aso, 79, who also doubles as deputy prime minister, has been a core member of Abe's administration. Without a clear consensus on who should succeed Abe, LDP lawmakers could elect Aso as a temporary leader if Abe resigns.
In 2008, Aso was elected LDP leader and hence, premier, in hopes that he could revive the long-dominant party's fortunes. Instead, the LDP was ousted in a historic election defeat in 2009, languishing in the opposition for the next three years.
The grandson of a former premier, Aso mixes policy experience with a fondness for manga comics and a tendency towards gaffes.
SHIGERU ISHIBAA hawkish former defence minister and rare LDP critic of Abe, Ishiba, 63, regularly tops surveys of lawmakers whom voters want to see as the next premier, but is less popular with the party's lawmakers.
The soft-spoken security maven has also held portfolios for agriculture and reviving local economies.
He defeated Abe in the first round of a party presidential election in 2012, thanks to strong grassroots support, but lost in the second round when only MPs could vote. Then, in a 2018 party leadership poll, Ishiba lost heavily to Abe.
He has criticised the Bank of Japan's ultra-low interest rates for hurting regional banks and called for higher public works spending to remedy growing inequality.
FUMIO KISHIDAKishida, 63, served as foreign minister under Abe from 2012 to 2017, but diplomacy remained mainly in the prime minister's grip.
The low-key lawmaker from Hiroshima has been widely seen as Abe's preferred successor but ranks low in voter surveys.
Kishida hails from one of the party's more dovish factions and is seen as less keen on revising the post-war constitution's pacifist Article 9 than Abe, for whom it is a cherished goal.
The BOJ's hyper-easy monetary policy ""cannot go on forever,"" Kishida has said.
TARO KONODefence Minister Taro Kono, 56, has a reputation as a maverick but has toed the line on key Abe policies, including a stern stance in a feud with South Korea over wartime history.
Educated at Georgetown University and a fluent English speaker, he previously served as foreign minister and minister for administrative reform.
He has differentiated his conservative stances from those of his father, former chief cabinet secretary Yohei Kono, who authored a landmark 1993 apology to ""comfort women"", a euphemism for women forced to work in Japan's wartime military brothels.
YOSHIHIDE SUGASuga, 71, a self-made politician and loyal lieutenant since Abe's troubled term as premier in 2006 and 2007, was among a band of allies who pushed Abe to run again for the top post in 2012.
Back in office, Abe tapped Suga as chief cabinet secretary, acting as top government spokesman, coordinating policies and keeping bureaucrats in line.
Talk of Suga as a contender bubbled up in April 2019 after he unveiled the new imperial era name, ""Reiwa"", for use on Japanese calendars after the enthronement of the new emperor.
Suga's clout was dented somewhat by scandals that toppled two cabinet ministers close to him last October.
SHINJIRO KOIZUMIThe name of Koizumi, 39, now environment minister and the son of charismatic former premier Junichiro Koizumi, is often floated as a future premier, but many consider him too young.
He shares some of Abe's conservative views and has paid his respects at Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni Shrine for war dead.
Koizumi has projected a reforming image on the basis of efforts to cut Japan's backing for coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, but has typically taken care not to offend party elders.
TOSHIMITSU MOTEGICurrently foreign minister, Motegi, 64, previously served as economy minister, facing off with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in tough negotiations.
He also served as trade minister post under Abe when the latter returned to power in 2012, tackling talks on the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact.
Educated at the University of Tokyo and Harvard, Motegi was first elected to the lower house in 1993 from the then-opposition Japan New Party and joined the LDP in 1995.
KATSUNOBU KATO, YASUTOSHI NISHIMURAAs health minister, Kato, 64, was in the limelight in the early days of Japan's coronavirus outbreak but then Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, 57, a former trade official, emerged as point person on virus policy.
In 2015, Kato, a father of four, was handed the portfolio for boosting Japan's rock-bottom birth rate, a task that met little success. He is a former official of the finance ministry.
SEIKO NODANoda, 59, has made no secret of her desire to become Japan's first female premier. An Abe critic, the former internal affairs minister, who also held the portfolio for women's empowerment, fell short of backing to join the race for party leader in 2018.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-funds-global-poll-idUSKBN25O1R1,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/whats-next-after-japan-pm-shinzo-abe-quits-potential-successors/articleshow/77800669.cms

For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App.","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s prime minister said on Friday he was open to discussions over whether Australian mass killer Brenton Tarrant, jailed for life without parole this week for the New Zealand mosque shootings, should serve his sentence in his home country. 
Scott Morrison told broadcaster Channel Seven he had not received a formal request from New Zealand for such a transfer, although New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters suggested it after Tarrant was sentenced on Thursday. 
“We’ll have an open discussion and look at the issues around this,” Morrison said, adding that the views of the affected families would need to be considered first. 
“I know all Australians and all New Zealanders would want to see this character locked up forever and never see the light of day again. And I agree with that. Whether he’s held in New Zealand or Australia.” 
Tarrant, who grew up in a rural town north of Sydney, admitted to 51 charges of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one charge of committing a terrorist act for the 2019 shooting rampage at two mosques in Christchurch. 
While Australia and New Zealand have close visa arrangements, they do not have a prisoner transfer deal, creating a hurdle to any near-term change in Tarrant’s imprisonment. 
Special security measures for Tarrant are expected to cost taxpayers NZ$3.6 million ($2.4 million) over two years or nearly NZ$5,000 a day, according to New Zealand government estimates. 
The issue of Tarrant’s nationality was raised several times during this week’s sentencing hearings in Christchurch. 
High Court Judge Cameron Mander said he believed Tarrant came to New Zealand to carry out the attacks to cause fear in what is otherwise one of the safest countries in the world. 
John Milne, who lost a son in the attack, told the court on Wednesday that Tarrant had to be sent “back to Australia where he came from”.

3795495,0,0,Govt should announce special stimulus package for auto industry: Bosch,10 things you need to know before the opening bell on August 28 - CNBCTV18,"The government should come up with a special stimulus package for the domestic automobile industry in order to revive the segment which is expected to de-grow in the current financial year as well, Auto components major Bosch said.
While addressing shareholders at the company's 68th annual general meeting (AGM), Bosch Ltd Chairman Bernhard Straub said the downtrend in the Indian automotive segment continues against the backdrop of cyclical and structural changes accompanied by added pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic uncertainties.
The nationwide lockdown followed by cluster wise lockdowns and uncertainties have led to the first quarter of the current fiscal seeing the deepest decline ever, he added.
The domestic tractor market is witnessing a bounce back to normal levels followed by two-wheeler and passenger cars, while light commercial vehicles also are showing signs of revival, he noted.
' On the other hand, the heavy commercial vehicle industry has not yet shown any signs of revival, Straub said.
""Against this backdrop, the automotive sector is expected to show de-growth for the financial year 2020-21. In this context, it is important that the central government comes up soon with a special comprehensive stimulus package for the automotive sector,"" he said.
Investments in construction activities and infrastructure have to continue to boost the demand side, he added.
Straub said the Indian economy is expected to see the sharpest contraction in 40 years and as reports suggest India's GDP for the financial year 2020-21 will be negative by 3.5 to 5 per cent.
This is primarily due to rising COVID-19 infections and weak fiscal stimulus resulting in lower inclination to consume, especially as credit growth remains muted and banks are saddled by rising bad loans, he noted.
""At the same time, the rural areas of the country are expected to lead the demand recovery, driven by better minimum support price for the upcoming Kharif harvest and increased MNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) spends in allied business activities. Also, the rural areas have seen a lesser impact of COVID-19 as compared to the urban areas,"" Straub said.
Terming the last fiscal as challenging in terms of business, Straub said the company's exports, the bulk of which were to Germany, China, Brazil, Bangladesh and Malaysia decreased by around 21 per cent as compared to the previous year.
The company's total revenue from operations declined 18.6 per cent to Rs 9,841.6 crore in 2019-20 as compared with 2018-19 on a comparable basis, he said.
""The domestic revenue from operations of your company declined 19.8 per cent; whereas export revenues declined by 3.6 per cent,"" he told shareholders.
Straub noted that the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown that followed disrupted established supply chains and showed the need for the industry as a whole to be more flexible and agile in its processes.
The difficulties are not expected to abate anytime soon and it will take a few years for the industry to recover completely, he said.
""It is inevitable that the current situation will have a less than favourable effect on our production and growth. We believe that it will take at least four to five years for the auto industry in India to get back to normal. We may have to shift our gears down to tackle rough roads, but our engines of growth and our clear vision of the future will take us steadily forward,"" Straub said.

Agriculture accounts for near 15 percent of India's USD 2.8 trillion economy and is a source of livelihood for more than half of its 1.3 billion people.

814556,0,0,Exclusive: Most U.S. states reject Trump administration's new COVID-19 testing guidance - Reuters,Trump says India 2nd largest country to conduct COVID-19 tests after US - Livemint,"(Reuters) - A majority of U.S. states have rejected new Trump administration COVID-19 testing guidance in an extraordinary rebuke of the nation’s top agency for disease prevention, according to officials at state health agencies and public statements reviewed by Reuters. 
At least 33 states continue to recommend testing people who have been exposed to COVID-19 and have no symptoms, spurning guidance published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week that said testing may be unnecessary. Sixteen states did not immediately respond to requests for comment and North Dakota said it had not made a decision. 
Among the states breaking with the federal government are conservative-leaning Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona. 
Public health experts said a rupture of this magnitude with the CDC may be unprecedented and shows deepening distrust of the Trump administration and its response to the pandemic. 
“This is states almost all-out rebelling against the new guidelines,” said Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 
The CDC said on Monday that people exposed to COVID-19 but not symptomatic “do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health care provider or State or local public health officials recommend you take one.” 
The CDC had previously recommended testing of all people who had close contact with someone who was diagnosed with COVID-19. That remains the policy of at least 30 states. Some that have not changed policy said they were studying the CDC guidance. 
(GRAPHIC: Majority of U.S. states rebuff CDC's new COVID-19 testing guidance - here) 
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the CDC, said the new guidance does not discourage asymptomatic individuals from being tested. 
She said that public officials who are breaking with the administration “have incorrectly interpreted the guidance. The CDC guidance states ‘the decision to be tested should be one made in collaboration with public health officials or your health care provider based on individual circumstances and the status of community spread.’” 
Some state leaders and public health experts accuse the administration of using politics rather than science to guide its response to the pandemic. 
“This 180-degree reversal of COVID-19 testing guidelines is reckless, and not based on science and has the potential to do long-term damage to the (CDC’s) reputation,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and the governors of New Jersey and Connecticut said in a statement, rejecting the new CDC guidance. 
Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at HHS, said there was no political pressure from the administration. He said testing asymptomatic patients too early could produce false negatives and contribute to the virus’s spread. 
“It’s pointless to be tested for the five to seven days (after infection) because you’re not going to be positive,” said David Battinelli, chief medical officer at Northwell Health, acknowledging concerns over testing too early. “There is an enormous amount of unnecessary testing going on.” 
Idaho recommends that people exposed to COVID-19 contact their doctor to determine if they need testing. It was among the states that did not respond to a request for comment on the CDC guidance. 
Public health officials believe the United States needs to test more frequently, that it is crucial to find asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers to slow the spread, and that the CDC’s comments could risk discouraging necessary testing. 
Even before the CDC guidance, the number of coronavirus tests being conducted was on a decline. The United States tested on average 675,000 people a day last week, down from a peak of more than 800,000 people a day in late July. 
Nationally, cases have fallen for five weeks in a row but infections are surging again in the U.S. Midwest with four states reporting record one-day increases in cases on Thursday as the U.S. death toll climbed above 180,000. 
Reporting by Carl O'Donnell, Vishwadha Chander and Manojna Maddipatla; Editing by Peter Henderson and Daniel Wallis","President Donald Trump has said that the US has conducted the highest number of COVID-19 tests, much more than any other country with India being the second largest.Trump, in his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention which re-nominated him as the Republican Party's presidential candidate, said that the US has conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation which is India.
We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma,"" he said on Thursday night.
You saw that on Sunday night when we announced that we'll save thousands and thousands of lives. Thanks to advances, we have pioneered the fatality rate. And you look at it and you look at the numbers, it has been reduced by 80 per cent since April,"" Trump said.
Trump delivered his speech to a group of over 1,000 supporters on the South Lawn of the White House. Many did not wear face masks and were seated close together.
The US is among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world, Trump said.
The European Union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours, but you don't hear that. They don't write about that. They don't want to write about that. They don't want you to know those things.
All together, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30 per cent greater increase and excess mortality than the United States,"" said the president.
In recent months, the United States and the world has been hit by the once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe.
They could have stopped it but they allowed it to come out. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude,"" he said.
Criticising his Democratic Party rival Joe Biden, Trump said unlike the former vice president, his administration focuses on the science, the facts and the data"" to handle the coronavirus pandemic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.,,,,"" Trump, who had earlier dismissed the pandemic as not a major health issue for the country, said.
Many Americans, including him, sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease, Trump said.
As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that had been so tragically taken. So unnecessary.
In their honour, we will unite. In their memory, we will overcome. And when the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilisation since World War II. Invoking the Defence Production Act, we produced the world's largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator which is a miracle,"" Trump added.
More than 180,000 people have died from the coronavirus pandemic since the start of the outbreak in the US, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
Nearly 5.8 million cases have also been confirmed nationwide, making America the worst-hit country in the world after the disease emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year.
Trump repeatedly claimed there would be a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, and also implied it could be available sooner.
We are delivering life-saving therapies, and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner,"" Trump said at one point.
We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before.
Nobody thought it could ever be done this fast. We are producing them in advance, so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available,"" Trump said.
We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year,"" Trump assured, and together we will crush the virus.""
""Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticise,"" Trump said.
""When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died,"" he said.
According to the Indias Union Health Ministry data, India's COVID-19 tally stands at 33,87,500 while the death toll at 61,529.
A cumulative total of 3,94,77,848 samples have been tested up to August 27 with 9,01,338 samples being tested on Thursday in India, according to the ministry's data.

1380521,0,0,US election: Donald Trump assails rival Joe Biden in acceptance speech,Focus of latest U.S. racial flashpoint shifts to accused Kenosha vigilante - Reuters Africa,"WASHINGTON: A defiant President Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination for a second term on Thursday with a scathing attack on rival Joe Biden, asserting that a Democratic victory in November would only exacerbate the racial strife and coronavirus pandemic besieging the nation.
Speaking from the White House South Lawn despite criticism he was using the executive residence as a political prop, Trump portrayed Biden, a career politician with a long record as a moderate, as a far-left extremist who would usher in a lawless, dangerous America.
This election will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans, or whether we give free rein to violent anarchic agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens, Trump said on the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention in a speech that lasted more than an hour.
No one will be safe in Bidens America.
Despite the pandemic that has killed more than 180,000 Americans, Trump delivered his remarks before a crowd of more than 1,000 people, standing in front of dozens of American flags and basking in chants of Four more years! and U.S.A.!
His language was evocative of his 2016 convention acceptance speech, which also came at a time of racial tension after eight police officers were killed in Texas and Louisiana amid protests following shootings of Black men.
Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities, he said then, vowing to end the turmoil.
But Trump, who ran successfully as an insurgent four years ago, is now in control at the White House, complicating his assertion once again that only he can solve the problem.
As the night unfolded, Biden struck back on Twitter, writing, When Donald Trump says tonight you wont be safe in Joe Biden's America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trumps America?
In trying to paint Biden as a tool of the radical left, Trump also distorted the Democrats policy positions on a host of other issues, including immigration, guns, law enforcement, abortion and energy production.
If given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness, Trump warned.
Following the speech, fireworks exploded over the nearby Washington Monument as the president and his family looked on, giving Trump and the convention a powerful closing image.
The crowd, seated in white chairs inches apart, showed little evidence of social distancing or face masks despite health experts recommendations. But the Trump campaign said it had taken appropriate health precautions in arranging the South Lawn event.
In a reminder of the countrys divisions, attendees could hear anti-Trump protesters sounding horns near the White House as he spoke, a noise that occasionally was audible on the live broadcast.
Shifting BlameIn his speech on Thursday, Trump again blamed China for the pandemic and promised in his second term to levy tariffs on any company that left America to create jobs overseas, one of the rare concrete policy proposals of the night.
He also promised to rebuild what Republicans have called the greatest economy in history and attacked Biden for saying he would shut down the country if necessary to slow the spread of the disease. Many health experts blame a resurgence of coronavirus cases on states that reopened businesses too soon.
Joe Bidens plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather a surrender, Trump said.","KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - An accused teenage vigilante facing charges he killed two people protesting in support of Jacob Blake Jr., the Black man shot in the back by a white policeman in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was due to appear in an Illinois courtroom on Friday. 
Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was charged on Thursday in Wisconsin with six criminal counts of first-degree intentional homicide, attempted homicide and reckless endangerment. 
He was scheduled to make his first court appearance in Lake County, Illinois, where he was arrested on Wednesday, for a hearing on a request from Wisconsin authorities to have him extradited from Illinois. 
Adding to the attention surrounding the case, Rittenhouse will be defended by a prominent law firm whose clients have included President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani and former Trump adviser Carter Page. 
Lawyer John Pierce told Reuters on Thursday that he and colleagues at the firm, Pierce Bainbridge, had been retained to represent the teenager and were determined to obtain justice for him. L. Lin Wood, another member of the Rittenhouse’s legal team, told CBS News his client had acted in self-defense. 
“He was not there to create trouble, but he found himself with his life threatened, and he had the right to protect himself,” Wood said. 
Sunday’s police shooting, in which Blake was gunned down and left paralyzed, turned Kenosha, a predominantly white city of about 100,000 residents on Lake Michigan, into the latest flashpoint in a summer of protests in the United States over police brutality and racism. 
Rittenhouse, a resident of Antioch, Illinois whose arrest warrant listed his occupation as a lifeguard, is accused of shooting three protesters, two fatally, during demonstrations on Tuesday night in Kenosha. 
Video footage from Tuesday’s incident shows a young, white gunman firing an assault-style rifle at protesters who tried to subdue him, then walking calmly away from the scene, hands in the air - with his rifle slung around his neck - as several police vehicles drive by without stopping him. 
According to the criminal complaint, another video shows Rittenhouse saying, “I just killed somebody,” after shooting one of his alleged victims, 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum, who was gunned down in the parking lot of a used-car dealer. 
MARCH ON WASHINGTON 
The renewed drive for racial justice across the country was ignited on May 25 when George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, died in police custody under the knee of a white officer. 
Protesters planned a march on Washington on Friday, commemorating the anniversary of the 1963 rally where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. 
The civil strife of recent months has drawn comparisons to the outpouring of anger and civil unrest that flared after King’s assassination in 1968. 
In Kenosha, three nights of skirmishes between protesters and police in riot gear following Blake’s shooting gave way on Wednesday and Thursday to peaceful, smaller demonstrations. 
The police officers involved in the Kenosha incident, including Rusten Sheskey, a seven-year veteran of the police force identified by authorities as having fired all seven shots at Blake from directly behind him, have been placed on leave. 
Blake’s family and protesters have demanded the officers be fired and prosecuted. The investigation has been turned over to the Wisconsin Justice Department, while the U.S. Justice Department has opened a civil rights inquiry. 
The exact sequence of events leading to Blake’s shooting remain sketchy. 
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said on Wednesday the confrontation stemmed from a domestic complaint lodged by a girlfriend, and that investigators had recovered a knife from the front floorboard of the car that Blake was leaning into when he was shot from behind at point-blank range. 
Blake’s lead attorney, civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, said his client had no knife in his possession and did nothing to provoke or threaten police before he was shot.

7754871,0,0,US Election 2020: Donald Trump accepts Republican Party’s re-nomination as presidential candidate,Top headlines: Two options for GST compensation Covid to hit IT employees,"US President Donald Trump has officially accepted the re-nomination of the Republican Party as its presidential candidate for the November elections, telling his fellow Americans that at no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas.
Trump, 74, in his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House amidst cheers from his supporters on Thursday night, said: My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States.
I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years, Trump said.
In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity! he said.
Party's delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
Pence delivered his acceptance speech from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday. This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Addressing an audience of about 1,500 invited guests, Trump said that the Republican Party goes forward united, determined and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
Trump and Pence are being challenged by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin senator Kamala Harris.
Harris, 55, has scripted history by becoming the first African-American and Indian-origin person to be nominated as a vice presidential candidate by a major political party.
As per an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days from now is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump's acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party, which gathers once in four years in one of the American cities to nominate its presidential candidate.
This year it was scheduled to be held in Charlotte in North Carolina. Due to the restrictions on social gatherings as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the convention went into a virtual mode, with only essential official business being held in Charlotte.
Popular Indian-American politician Nikki Haley was the star speaker on Monday, the first day. First Lady Melania Trump addressed the convention from Rose Garden of the White House on Tuesday, while Pence delivered his acceptance speech on Wednesday.
Trump's daughter Ivanka, who is also his presidential advisor, addressed the convention before him on Thursday night.
He's our commander-in-chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. He is our president, and my father, Donald J Trump, Ivanka said.
His son Donald Trump Jr addressed the convention on Monday, while daughter Tiffney and other son Eric addressed the convention on Tuesday and daughter-in-law Lara on Wednesday. A group of protesters had gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House in advance of Trump's speech.
Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, and his wife were among the special invitees on the South Lawns of the White House for Trump's acceptance speech. Al Mason said it was amazing spectacular and full of enthusiasm never seen in the Democratic convention last week.","Unlock BFSI 2.0: Banks' extreme risk aversion self-defeating, says RBI Governor Das

LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Stock markets struggled for direction on Friday as investors worried about a lack of detail in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy shift while Japanese markets were roiled as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe resigned for health reasons. 
The Fed’s widely-awaited shift in its policy framework, unveiled on Thursday, saw the central bank place more emphasis on boosting economic growth and less on worries about letting inflation run too high. The policy aims for 2% inflation on average so that too low a pace would be followed by an effort to lift inflation “moderately above 2% for some time.” 
Stocks initially jolted higher as investors bet interest rates would remain low for longer and more stimulus was likely. 
But share markets have since been choppy, with some traders disappointed that the Fed did not reveal more details about how the new framework will work or provide any clues as to what it will do at its next policy meeting. 
“It’s not so much about what to do about inflation when it comes but about getting inflation above target. The challenge is to get inflation up to target and not very much was said about that,” said Colin Asher, a senior economist at Mizuho. 
The Euro STOXX 50 recovered from earlier losses and was last up 0.03%, while Germany’s DAX slid 0.49%. Britain’s FTSE 100 was 0.4% higher. 
U.S. stock futures clawed their way higher and back to near record levels after earlier volatile trading on concern about the impact of a hurricane that struck the centre of the U.S. oil industry. S&amp;P 500 e-mini futures was were last up 0.34%. 
Japanese shares dropped, with the Nikkei 225 down 1.4%. Abe resigned on Friday because of a chronic health condition, saying he would stay as prime minister until a new leader was appointed. 
There has been speculation about his health all week. 
Asian shares outside of Japan limped higher, with the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gaining 0.19%. 
“This is a negative for Japanese stocks because it raises questions about what polices come next. We do see the familiar pattern of falling stocks pushing up the yen,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. 
The yen, seen as a safe-haven currency to buy in times of uncertainty, jumped 0.4% to 106.12 yen per dollar. 
Elsewhere in currency markets the dollar dropped 0.6% against a basket of other currencies =USD&gt;. 
The greenback has fallen sharply since June as many analysts are predicting more pain ahead given U.S. rates are likely to stay low for longer and the political uncertainty before the U.S. presidential election in November. 
The euro seized on the dollar’s weakness to gallop another 0.7% higher and was last at $1.1905, close to a more than two-year high it recently touched. 
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to as high as 0.789%, the most since June 10, which caused the yield curve to steepen, reflecting the Fed’s tolerance for higher inflation. It was last at 0.7671%, still up 2 basis points on the session. 
Crude oil prices dipped as a massive storm raced inland past the heart of the U.S. oil industry in Louisiana and Texas without causing any widespread damage to refineries. 
Brent crude fell 0.47% to $44.88 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude dropped 0.49% to $42.83 per barrel. 
Gold prices bounced 1%, with the spot price at $1,949 an ounce. The precious metal tends to perform well when the dollar is weak and the U.S. central bank sends a dovish message on the future path of interest rates.

3298659,0,0,"Explained: Covid-19 reaches the Great Andamanese, why is this worrying?",US election: Trump accepts Republican Party's presidential re-nomination,"A Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG), the Great Andamanese now number only 59.Nine members of the dwindling Great Andamanese tribe have tested Covid-19 positive, setting off alarm bells in the Union Territory. While the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have so far recorded 2,985 novel coronavirus cases, 676 of which are active, it is for the first time that cases are reported from among the five Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) living in the islands.
Besides the Great Andamanese, the other four PVTGs are Jarawas, Onges, Sentinelese and Shorn Pens. Among the five, the Great Andamanese are the only ones who visit and live in the capital city of Port Blair frequently. The PVTGs are communities that are more vulnerable among tribal groups, and are put under a special category by the government of India.
While five among the nine Great Andamanese who are infected are residents of Port Blair, four others live in the remote Strait Island that is reserved for the tribe.
Anthropologists classify the Great Andamanese as part of the Negrito tribes that inhabit isolated parts of Southeast Asia and the Andaman Islands. Linguists Anju Saxena and Lars Borin, in their book, Lesser-Known Languages of South Asia: Status and Policies, Case Studies and Applications of Information Technology, write that recent studies by geneticists indicate that the Andamanese are possibly related to the Negritos of the Malay peninsula and in the Philippines.
Originally, the Great Andamanese were ten distinct tribes, including the Jeru, Bea, Bo, Khora, and Pockiwar, each with its own separate language. In 1788, when the British first tried to colonise the islands, the Great Andamanese numbered between 5,000 and 8,000. However, several members of the tribe were killed in encounters with the British to protect their territories. Later, many were wiped out in epidemics brought in by the colonisers, such as measles, syphilis and influenza.
After the 1857 mutiny, the British government sent thousands of mutineers for life imprisonment in the Andamans. A penal colony was established for the purpose. The new phase of settlement caused the death of many Great Andamanese as they succumbed to diseases and imperialist policies.
In the 1860s, the British established an Andaman Home where they kept captured Great Andamanese. Hundreds of the tribe died from the disease and abuse in the home, and of 150 babies born there, none survived beyond the age of two, says a report in the Survival International, which is a human rights organisation campaigning for the rights of tribes.
By 1901, the population of the Great Andamanese was down to 625. By the 1930s, the number had further gone below 100. In 1970, the Indian government removed the remaining Great Andamanese to the Strait Island. At present, only about 59 members of the community survive — 34 live in the Strait Island, the rest are in Port Blair.
The language of the Great Andamanese, Sare, has largely been lost, with the last surviving speaker dying earlier this year. The tribe now speaks mostly Hindi.
Major factors contributing to the diminishing population of the Great Andamanes include environmental disturbances, contagious diseases as a result of contact with city dwellers, and a high mortality rate assisted by addictions to alcohol, tobacco and opium, write Saxena and Borin.
Unlike the other PVTGs in the Andamans, the Great Andamanese are in contact with the general population since they visit Port Blair frequently, thereby making them more vulnerable to Covid-19.

Trump, 74, in his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House amidst cheers from his supporters on Thursday night, said: My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States.
I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years, Trump said.
In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity! he said.
Party's delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
Pence delivered his acceptance speech from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday. This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Addressing an audience of about 1,500 invited guests, Trump said that the Republican Party goes forward united, determined and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
Trump and Pence are being challenged by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin senator Kamala Harris.
Harris, 55, has scripted history by becoming the first African-American and Indian-origin person to be nominated as a vice presidential candidate by a major political party.
As per an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days from now is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump's acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party, which gathers once in four years in one of the American cities to nominate its presidential candidate.
This year it was scheduled to be held in Charlotte in North Carolina. Due to the restrictions on social gatherings as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the convention went into a virtual mode, with only essential official business being held in Charlotte.
Popular Indian-American politician Nikki Haley was the star speaker on Monday, the first day. First Lady Melania Trump addressed the convention from Rose Garden of the White House on Tuesday, while Pence delivered his acceptance speech on Wednesday.
Trump's daughter Ivanka, who is also his presidential advisor, addressed the convention before him on Thursday night.
He's our commander-in-chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. He is our president, and my father, Donald J Trump, Ivanka said.
His son Donald Trump Jr addressed the convention on Monday, while daughter Tiffney and other son Eric addressed the convention on Tuesday and daughter-in-law Lara on Wednesday. A group of protesters had gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House in advance of Trump's speech.
Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, and his wife were among the special invitees on the South Lawns of the White House for Trump's acceptance speech. Al Mason said it was amazing spectacular and full of enthusiasm never seen in the Democratic convention last week.

It’s the first doubleheader in the history of Milwaukee’s Miller Park, and just the second between these two clubs all time. The Reds and Brewers mutually agreed to boycott Wednesday’s scheduled contest in the wake of unrest and violence following Sunday’s police shooting involving black 29-year-old Jacob Blake, in nearby Kenosha, Wis. 
Winker and Nick Castellanos combined to go 6-for-6 with two homers and five RBIs as the Reds broke out after totaling just six runs in their previous four contests. Gray (5-1), meanwhile, allowed four hits and two walks while striking out four in going five of the seven-inning game. 
Omar Narvaez homered in the sixth inning for Milwaukee, which won the first two games of the set, on Monday and Tuesday. Teammate Orlando Arcia recorded two hits for the Brewers. 
Cincinnati opened the scoring in the second inning via Curt Casali’s RBI single off Brewers starter Adrian Houser. The Reds went up 2-0 when Castellanos crushed a shot to center field for his 10th homer of 2020 in the third inning. Winker immediately followed with an opposite-field home run to left for a 3-0 Cincinnati advantage. 
Winker did it again in the fifth, this time a two-run homer to left-center field for his eighth of the season. It came off Milwaukee reliever Alex Claudio, but one of those runs was charged to Houser (1-3). The right-hander pitched into the fifth, and allowed four runs and nine hits while fanning three and walking one. 
Winker is 9-for-18 with two homers against Milwaukee this season. 
Castellanos added a sacrifice fly in the sixth inning to pad Cincinnati’s advantage before Narvaez got Milwaukee on the board in the bottom half of the frame.

5858407,0,0,Poland calls Lukashenko's words unacceptable as relations become tense - Reuters Africa,Explained: What happens when you damage a valuable piece of art?,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko’s comments that Warsaw may be plotting to seize part of the country if its political crisis worsened are unacceptable, Krzysztof Szczerski, an aide to Poland’s president, said on Friday. 
Relations between Warsaw and Minsk have become tense in recent days following Lukashenko’s suggestions quoted by state news agency Belta that Poland planned to take over the Grodno region bordering Poland and Lithuania if Belarus falls apart. 
On Thursday, Poland summoned the Belarus ambassador to protest the “unfounded accusations”. 
“These comments are unacceptable. No one has such intentions in Poland and this is propaganda,” Szczerski told public radio, adding the situation in Belarus is evolving in a negative direction. 
Belarus has been in turmoil since a presidential election on Aug. 9 that the opposition said was rigged to extend Lukashenko’s 26-year rule. Security forces have beaten and arrested protesters to stamp out mass demonstrations and strikes. 
Szczerski also said that following Russia’s latest signals that it is prepared to use force if needed in Belarus, the key question now is how Western Europe reacts. 
The West has so far acted cautiously, wary of provoking a Russian military response as took place in Ukraine in 2014. 
“If the West does not have a ‘we win, they lose’ approach to Russia, then Putin will be step by step expanding the Brezhnev Doctrine,” Szczerski said, referring to Soviet foreign policy under which Moscow intervened in the domestic affairs of its East Bloc satellites when developments displeased it. 
Warsaw is watching events in neighbouring Belarus closely, concerned over perceived resurgent aggressiveness by Russia in the region. It also sees itself as a key party in the West’s attempts to support the Belarusian people. 
News agency Belta reported on Thursday evening that the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Polish Charge d’Affaires to protest against Poland’s attempts to interfere in Belarus’ domestic affairs.

Picasso's Bust of a Woman, 1944 (left); Tate Modern in London. (Source: tate.org.uk, Wikimedia Commons)A student of architecture, Shakeel Ryan Massey, who punched a £20 million Picasso painting at Tate Modern in December 2019, was sentenced to 18 months in jail earlier this week by a court in London.
Media reports in the UK said Massey used metal padlocks in his hands wrapped in a scarf to smash through protective glass, punched the painting several times, pulled it off the wall, and threw it on the floor. He later claimed he was carrying out an art performance.
He told the court through his lawyer that his actions were nothing more than an attempt to seek notoriety and five minutes of fame.
Titled ‘Bust of a Woman’, the 1944 work depicts Picasso’s well known muse, the photographer Dora Maar. The work is owned by a private collector, and has been loaned to Tate Modern since 2011. Repairs could take up to 18 months and cost up to £350,000.
While art lovers were shocked after the incident, this isn’t the first time that a valuable work of art has been vandalised.
Here are five recent examples the offenders were sometimes spared, on other occasions they were made to pay a penalty or serve a jail sentence.
 ‘Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan on 16 November 1581’. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)Ilya Repin, ‘Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan on November 16, 1581’
One of the most closely watched art vandalism trials was that of the Russian Igor Podporin, who was charged with causing serious damage to Ilya Repins famous late 19th century painting of the grief-stricken Ivan IV Vasilyevich, commonly known as Ivan the Terrible, the first Tsar of Russia (1547-84), cradling his dying son in his arms after having dealt him a mortal blow.
The painting, which was completed in 1885, is considered a Russian cultural treasure.
Podporin, a (then) 37-year-old man from Voronezh in southwestern Russia, was arrested immediately after he struck the painting with a metal pole in May 2018. At a press conference, Russia’s then Deputy Culture Minister Vladimir Aristarkhov said that his Ministry expected the man to receive the most severe punishment possible.
Podporin initially claimed that he had drunk too much vodka before he attacked the painting, but changed his story later to say that he was driven by the fact that the painting was historically inaccurate. The painting is a lie, Podporin told the court, according to a Reuters report from 2018, quoting Russian news agencies. He (Tsar Ivan the Terrible) is ranked among the community of saints, the vandal said.
This version of history has gained traction recently in a certain nationalist narrative of Russia’s Tsarist past. Some Russian historians have submitted that Ivan did not actually murder his son, and President Vladimir Putin himself said in 2017 that it was not clear whether the Tsar was guilty as depicted.
In April 2019, a court in Moscow found Podporin guilty of vandalising the famous Repin, and sentenced him to two and a half years in prison.
 Black on Maroon, 1958. (Source: tate.org.uk)Mark Rothko, ‘Black on Maroon’
In May 2014, a painting by the American abstract expressionist master Mark Rothko was put back on display at Tate Modern after 18 months of restoration work.
The painting, which Rothko finished between 1958 and 1959, and donated to Tate in 1968, was vandalised by a Polish man named Wlodzimierz Umaniec who, on October 7, 2012, painted the words ‘A Potential Piece of Yellowism’ in a corner. He was subsequently reported to have claimed the vandalism was an artistic act, and compared himself to the French-American Marcel Duchamp, an acknowledged pioneer of conceptual art.
A London court jailed Umaniec for two years for vandalising the Rothko, reportedly valued at between £5 and £9 million, and said his actions were entirely deliberate, planned, and intentional.

Leonardo da Vinci, ‘Mona Lisa’
Arguably the world’s most recognised painting has been attacked multiple times. Most recently, a Russian woman who was angry at having been denied French citizenship, threw a coffee mug at the painting in 2009.
The first of the recent attacks on the masterpiece happened in the winter of 1956, when a homeless man named Hugo Unzaga Villegas threw a rock at it, apparently because he wanted to go to prison so he would get a warm bed.
Only a few months previously, acid had been thrown at the lower part of the painting when it was being shown in a museum in Montauban, France.
Then in 1974, a woman with disabilities sprayed the work with red paint while it was on display at the Tokyo National Museum, as she was upset over the lack of disabled access to it.
Cy Twombly, Untitled
In 2007, French-Cambodian artist Rindy Sam was fined after she kissed an all-white painting by the American artist Edwin Parker ‘Cy’ Twombly Jr., leaving a lipstick mark on the canvas.
The untitled canvas, reportedly worth $2.5 million, was on display at Collection Lambert in France.
Sam was reported to have said during a court hearing that she was overcome by passion when she saw the painting. I just gave it a kiss. It was an act of love, when I kissed it, I wasn’t thinking. I thought the artist would understand, she said.
She was ordered to pay 1,000 to the owner, 500 to the gallery, and a symbolic 1 to the artist.
Prior to this, at the Sao Paulo International Biennial in 1996, a painting from Andy Warhol’s 1977 Torsos series, which featured male and female nudes, was kissed by a Brazilian woman. The lipstick mark was removed without much trouble, and the accused was not punished or even publicly identified.

In February 2014, Miami artist Maximo Caminero, then 51, entered the Perez Art Museum, picked up a colour-dipped vase by the Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei, and threw it to the floor. The vase was one of 16 in an installation by Ai titled Coloured Vase.
Charged with criminal mischief, Caminero was reported to have said that he had smashed the artwork for all the local artists in Miami that have never been shown in museums here.
Some voices who defended Caminero and agreed with the criticism that galleries and museums preferred international artists to local ones, pointed out that Ai Weiwei had himself vandalised the valuable ancient artefact by painting it over in whimsical colours.
Caminero was reported to have suggested that he had been inspired by Ai’s celebrated 1995 work ‘Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn’, a series of three black-and-white photos that show Ai with what has been claimed to be a priceless 2,000-year-old vase in his hand, the vase in mid-air as it falls to the floor, and Ai standing impassively over shattered fragments of the vase. The work was on display at the Perez Museum, and the description of the three pictures said Ai had dropped the urn, dated from 206-200 BC, on the floor to express the notion that new ideas and values can be produced through iconoclasm, The New York Times reported at the time.
Be that as it may, Caminero still had to pay the insurers $10,000 restitution.

1033064,0,0,Walmart ad revenue could quickly jump if TikTok bid succeeds,Sushant Singh Rajput case: CBI questioning Rhea Chakraborty for first time,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc could turn into an online advertising leader if its plan to acquire popular short-form video app TikTok goes through, analysts said on Friday. 
The proposed purchase, in partnership with Microsoft Corp, would allow the world’s largest retailer to quickly compete with Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google for eyeballs on social media, reaching customers across virtual and physical sales channels. 
TikTok is up for sale as the Chinese-owned company is under fire from the Trump administration as a potential national security risk due to the vast amount of private data the app is compiling on U.S. consumers. 
Walmart, which pitched its ad business to large consumer goods companies and advertising firms for the first time last year, said on Thursday it was “confident” it could meet U.S. TikTok users’ expectations and satisfy U.S. regulators’ concerns. 
TikTok owner ByteDance aims to ink a deal by Sept. 15, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. 
“Walmart is going to see a very quick rise in ad spend” if its bid succeeds, said Scott Smigler, president of e-commerce marketing agency Exclusive Concepts. 
“From a brand standpoint, it’s a no brainer because of the reach Walmart has and the huge shift we’re seeing right now from offline to online (spending). ... For all of our brands and retailers that are eligible, we’re going to want them on Walmart for sure.” 
Last week, Walmart posted its biggest-ever quarterly growth in online sales, as the unprecedented spike in demand seen by big-box retailers at the peak of the coronavirus lockdowns has remained strong even as restrictions ease. 
Walmart does not break out revenue from sponsored ads for products sold on its website. But online ads yield much higher margins than product sales, and ad revenue is growing as the retailer boosts investments in the area. 
It has been more important than ever for Walmart to find new ways to win market share from its closest e-commerce rival Amazon.com, a fast-growing ad platform, as customers increasingly shop online. 
Amazon reported $4.2 billion in advertising and other revenue for the most recent quarter, nearly double what it brought in for the same period two years prior. That amount is up 41% from the year-ago period. 
Retailers including Target Corp and grocers such as Tesco Plc have aggressively wooed big advertisers to their websites to drive sales through pop-up banners and search-bar keywords. 
In July, Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart rolled out new features for its in-house advertising platform Walmart Media Group. 
Walmart has seized many opportunities to scoop up online brands like Bonobos, which it purchased for $310 million in 2017, and Art.com, which it bought for an undisclosed amount in 2018. 
In 2010, Walmart announced its new video-on-demand service with its acquisition of Vudu, which also offers a free ad-supported streaming option. However, Vudu still lags far behind the monthly viewership numbers that competitors Netflix and Hulu pull in, and Walmart sold it to Comcast Corp-owned Fandango Media LLC, a movie ticketing service, in April. 
Investors are viewing Walmart’s play for TikTok as a potential win, and are raring to know more details. 
“It’s really hard to put a value on the return they’re (Walmart) going to get from this” possible acquisition, said Randy Hare, portfolio manager at Huntington Private Bank. 
“But clearly the market’s excited about this because this could really help Walmart with a new channel of advertising.” 
Reporting by Melissa Fares in New York; Additional reporting by Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru, Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Vanessa O'Connell and Richard Chang","Actress Rhea Chakraborty, accused of abetting the suicide of filmstar Sushant Singh Rajput, reached the DRDO guest house here on Friday for questioning by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), an official said.
This is for the first time that Rhea Chakraborty (28) is being questioned by the CBI in the Sushant death case.
She was summoned by the central agency to appear before its probe team on Friday around 10.30 am, the official said.
Rhea Chakraborty, Rajput's girlfriend, left her residence around 10 am to reach the DRDO guest house in suburban Santacruz, where the probe team is stationed, he said.
Before Rhea Chakraborty's arrival, Rajputs friend and flatmate Siddharth Pithani and manager Samual Miranda had reached the DRDO guest house to join the investigation, the official said.
The CBI team, which is in the city since the last eight days to investigate the Sushant death case, on Thursday recorded the statement of her brother Showik Chakraborty. The recording of statement lasted for more than eight hours.
The CBI has so far questioned the late actor's flatmate Pithani, cook Neeraj Singh and domestic help Deepesh Sawant, among others, as part of its probe in the high-profile case.
Earlier, before the CBI took over the probe, the Mumbai police had recorded the statement of Rhea Chakraborty in connection with Rajput's death.
The Supreme Court last week upheld the transfer of an FIR, lodged by Rajput's father in Patna against Rhea Chakraborty and others for allegedly abetting his son's suicide and misappropriating his money, to the CBI.
The 34-year-old actor was found hanging on June 14 in his flat in suburban Bandra.

2622490,0,0,"‘Pained’: PM Modi tweets to ‘dear friend’ Shinzo Abe, praises his leadership - Hindustan Times","Legal hurdles, pandemic would bedevil Biden efforts to undo Trump immigration overhaul - Reuters","Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who shares personal chemistry with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said he was “pained” to hear about the outgoing Japan prime minister’s ill health and credited him for cementing relations between the two countries.
PM Modi tweeted to PM Abe hours after the Japanese prime minister announced his decision to resign from the top post due to his health condition. “Pained to hear about your ill health, my dear friend @AbeShinzo,” PM Modi said in a tweet. 
Pained to hear about your ill health, my dear friend @AbeShinzo. In recent years, with your wise leadership and personal commitment, the India-Japan partnership has become deeper and stronger than ever before. I wish and pray for your speedy recovery. pic.twitter.com/JjziLay2gD
— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) August 28, 2020
PM Modi also tweeted a 2018 photograph of the two leaders at an informal meeting during the 13th India-Japan Summit that took place at a resort near Mount Fuji in Japan in October 2018.
The next summit level meeting was scheduled to be held in December in Assam’s Guwahati but was deferred due to the protests against the anti-citizenship law. PM Abe and PM Modi were expected to hold the 14th India-Japan Summit via video conference on 10 September. But there is no clarity if the two countries, who were expected to seal a crucial military logistics pact, would be able to stick to this schedule in view of PM Abe’s health condition.
PM Modi credited PM Abe with playing a lead role in strengthening relations between the two countries. “In recent years, with your wise leadership and personal commitment, the India-Japan partnership has become deeper and stronger than ever before. I wish and pray for your speedy recovery,” PM  Modi said.
PM Modi is known to have been an admirer of the Japanese prime minister long before he moved from Gujarat to New Delhi in 2014. By all accounts, it was mutual. 
PM Abe was one of the first global leaders to congratulate Narendra Modi for his gigantic victory in 2014 well before all the votes were counted. Modi was also only one of the three people that PM Abe followed on Twitter back then. That number has still gone up to 18. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has been the other addition from India since then. As prime minister, Modi had made Japan his first port of call outside south Asia in September 2014 once he assumed charge in New Delhi.
PM Abe’s announcement to step down comes just days after he surpassed a record for longest consecutive tenure as premier set by his great-uncle Eisaku Sato half a century ago. He had then stressed that what was important was what a leader did in the top post, not the duration.
As PM Abe announced his decision to exit the government at a news conference on Thursday, he underlined that he could not be the prime minister if he could not make the best decisions for the people.
“I cannot be prime minister if I cannot make the best decisions for the people. I have decided to step down from my post,” Abe, 65, told a news conference.
Abe has battled the disease ulcerative colitis for years and two recent hospital visits within a week had fanned questions on whether he could stay in the job until the end of his term as ruling party leader, and hence, premier, in September 2021.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he will reverse some of President Donald Trump’s restrictive immigration policies should he win in November, but the dizzying number of changes could take months or years to undo, according to policy and regulatory experts and people close to the Biden campaign. 
They said Biden’s efforts also would be slowed by legal hurdles, political pressure to keep some measures, and a crowded agenda at the beginning of a presidency dominated by the novel coronavirus pandemic. 
“There are going to be a number of urgent matters that require immediate action, including dealing with a global pandemic that has taken hundreds of thousands of lives, including dealing with an economy that is in shambles, all due to President Trump’s failed leadership,” senior Biden campaign adviser Cristóbal Alex said. 
He said Biden was committed to reversing what he called Trump’s “horrific” immigration policies. 
Trump, carrying out a pledge of his “America First” 2016 campaign to reduce legal and illegal immigration, ordered travel bans, hardened efforts to deter Central American migrants entering at the U.S.-Mexico border and made it more difficult for people to obtain refugee status. His administration has blocked immigrants and temporary foreign workers from the United States, saying the moves were needed to preserve jobs for Americans as unemployment soared during coronavirus-related shutdowns. 
Some of the Republican president’s most far-reaching policies have been issued during the pandemic, including blocking many travelers from China, Iran, Europe and Brazil, and suspending non-essential travel across the borders with Canada and Mexico. 
While Biden has criticized some of these restrictions, he has not said if he would immediately reverse them. He has also not commented on emergency border rules implemented in March that allow U.S. authorities to rapidly expel border crossers, including unaccompanied children and asylum seekers. 
Julie Chávez Rodríguez, another senior adviser to the Biden campaign, said he would look to public health officials for guidance on pandemic-related border closures and accused Trump of trying to “scapegoat” immigrants with the restrictions on legal immigration. 
Some of Trump’s executive actions will be relatively easy to undo with the stroke of a pen. But finalized regulations that have gone through a period of public review typically take anywhere from several months to a year to unravel, and could take longer, according to four regulatory experts. Lawsuits could delay attempts to undo Trump regulations and smaller-scale memos and guidance issued to agencies. 
These logistical obstacles mean that Trump’s immigration legacy could endure well beyond his presidency, according to the policy experts, outside Biden campaign advisers and current and former Trump officials. Immigrant advocates who are hoping for faster change would likely be disappointed. 
`BREATHTAKING` 
The architect of Trump’s sweeping immigration agenda, senior adviser Stephen Miller, called the scope of the changes to the U.S. immigration system over the past 3-1/2 years “breathtaking” and “without precedent” - a description echoed by both Trump backers and opponents. 
Miller argued that measures finalized under Trump will not be easy to remove, just as his administration struggled to reverse some policies put in place by previous administrations. 
“In some distant, long-off future time when a Democrat is president, as we all have seen firsthand it is a difficult, complex and time-consuming thing to remove a regulation or a longstanding memorandum,” Miller said in an interview. 
The non-government Migration Policy Institute estimates that the administration has made more than 400 immigration policy changes. A separate tally by advocacy groups puts the figure closer to 1,000. 
The Biden campaign has established an immigration policy working group of volunteers composed of former government officials and immigration advocates. Amy Pope, a former homeland security adviser in the administration of former President Barack Obama, is playing a lead role, according to four people familiar with the effort. 
Several of the people said they were concerned about Pope’s involvement. While Obama did not invoke anti-immigrant rhetoric or attempt to curtail legal immigration, some 3 million immigrants were deported between 2009-2016, earning him the moniker “deporter in chief” from angry activists. Biden served as Obama’s vice president during that period. 
In a 2018 interview, Pope defended Obama’s decision to expand the detention of migrant families arrested at the border. 
The campaign declined to provide Reuters a list of the volunteers. Pope did not respond to a request for comment. 
Biden plans to send an immigration bill to Congress on his first day in office that includes a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally, according to campaign adviser Alex. The bill also would address the status of “Dreamers” who were brought to the United States as children but are now in the country illegally. 
Biden previously pledged to undo Trump’s travel ban on “Day 1” of his presidency, but that would now be slated for his first 100 days in office, according to Alex. The ban blocks a range of travelers from 13 countries, most of which are either majority-Muslim or African nations. 
These bans could be easily undone, as they were issued by executive order and presidential proclamation, the policy experts said, although any changes could be delayed by lawsuits from some conservatives. 
One policy that would be more difficult to undo is Trump’s so-called “public charge” rule, which makes it harder for poorer immigrants - those who receive certain public benefits or are deemed likely to do so - to obtain permanent residence. 
The rule was blocked nationwide by a federal judge in July for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency, but that injunction was later narrowed by an appeals court to apply to just three states. 
To remove the rule, a Biden administration would need to issue another regulation to rescind it unless Congress addressed it in legislation or courts invalidated it, regulatory experts said. 
The fate of Trump’s immigration legacy also would depend on the makeup of Congress after the Nov. 3 elections. If Democrats retain control of the House of Representatives and wrest the Senate from Republicans they will wield more power to push through their agenda. 
But even then it might not be easy. Trump failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature health care reform law, even as his party controlled the House and Senate during the first two years of his presidency.

1350681,0,0,India’s case trajectory tops US Covid-19 peak - Hindustan Times,Bangladesh's Beximco signs COVID-19 vaccine deal with India's Serum Institute - Reuters India,"New Delhi ’s trajectory of daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday became the highest ever recorded by any country, which means that the outbreak in the country currently is worse than it was at the peak in the United States (US) – the worst-hit nation in the world.
At an average, 69,558 new cases were reported in India every day over the past week, placing it above the seven-day daily case peak recorded in the US when the number touched 69,330 for the week ending July 25. The US’s trajectory was the worst in the world in the eight months since the coronavirus disease surfaced in December 2019.
On Friday, India reported 76,139 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of cases in the country to 3,458,186. To be sure, the US has over six million confirmed infections, more than 1.8 times those in India, which is unlikely to overtake America any time soon.
Brazil, which is the country with the second-highest number of total cases, has around 350,000 more cases than India. The South American nation, however, has been adding around 30,000 fewer cases than India every day recently, so the latter has been closing the gap fast.
New cases in India have been rising at an alarming rate and have shown no signs of a let-up. India’s doubling rate — the rate at which the total cases in the country would double — was 32 days on Friday against 96 days in the US and 68 in Brazil. For doubling rates, a higher number mean rising at an alarming rate and have shown no signs of a let-up. India’s doubling rate — the rate at which the total cases in the country would double — was 32 days on Friday against 96 days in the US and 68 in Brazil. For doubling rates, a higher number means cases are growing at a slower (thus better) rate. In fact, India has the worst doubling rate among the world’s 10 worst-hit nations.
However, with 62,703 total deaths as of Friday, India’s case fatality rate (CFR) – the proportion of deaths among the confirmed cases — is 1.8%, which is not only much better than the global average of 3.4%, but also better than the US (3.1%) and Brazil (3.2%).
The US became the worst-hit nation in the world on the back of two separate and massive case spikes. The first spike, which was milder, peaked towards early April and was centred in the country’s north-east with states such as New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania reporting high cases.
Towards the end of June, a second spike started with new epicentres such as California, Texas and Florida, pushing new cases to record highs again. In this phase, the US set the global record for the highest cases in a single day on July 24 when it reported 78,586 infections. The country’s seven-day average peaked a day later on July 25. Since then, this wave of infections has also waned and the country is currently reporting around 42,000 new cases every day. 
In Brazil, the trajectory has been the most erratic of these three. It has seen smaller waves of infections that have dropped thrice — in mid-June, mid-July and mid-August. However, cases appear to have hit a plateau in the past two weeks, averaging around 37,000 new cases every day, against over 46,000 in the last week of July.
Unlike the other two nations where the new case trend lines are uneven, the caseload in India has grown gradually and has not had any abrupt spike. But this does not necessarily translate to good news because it also means that the trajectory in India has never hit a plateau. With almost all states (except Delhi) reporting record high cases over the past few weeks, this trajectory has not yet exhibited any signs of slowing down.
To be sure, the three countries are rather similar demographically, which may explain the extended trajectory of the pandemic. The US is the world’s third largest country by geographical area, Brazil fifth, and India seventh. As the infection wanes in one part of the country, it waxes in another. In terms of population, India is the second most populous country in the world, the US third, and Brazil sixth. Expectedly, per capita infection and death numbers are low for all three countries compared to smaller and less populous nations.","DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh’s Beximco Pharmaceuticals BXPH.DH is investing in the Serum Institute of India (SII) to ensure Dhaka gets priority access to COVID-19 vaccines being developed by the Indian drug manufacturer, the company said on Friday. 
The deal announced by the Bangladeshi generic drugmaker comes after Dhaka said this month it was ready to hold trials of candidate vaccines being developed by India as both countries seek to curb the spread of the virus. 
SII has partnered with AstraZeneca (AZN.L), the Gates Foundation and the Gavi vaccine alliance to produce more than a billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccine for global supply. 
“The investment amount will be treated as an advance and once the vaccine receives regulatory approvals, SII will include Bangladesh among the countries who will be the first to receive an agreed quantity of this vaccine from SII on a priority basis,” Beximco said in a statement. 
It did not give details about the size of the investment in SII nor how many vaccines Beximco might receive. 
“This landmark agreement reflects the deep-rooted desire for collaboration between the two countries and as representatives of the two nations, between us we can go a long way towards helping to mitigate the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” the heads of both companies said in the statement. 
It said Beximco would be the exclusive supplier in Bangladesh for the vaccine being developed by SII and that the Bangladeshi company would discuss with the government the number of doses it wants. Beximco will also secure additional doses to be distributed to the private pay market in Bangladesh. 
The Serum Institute is the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume. It is holding trials for three potential coronavirus vaccines, including one licensed to AstraZeneca by Oxford University. 
Bangladesh has also approved a late-stage trial of a potential coronavirus vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd (SVA.O) in the hope of being a priority recipient for the jab. 
Bangladesh confirmed 47 more deaths and reported 2,211 new cases on Friday, taking the total number of cases in the country to 306,794 with 4,174 deaths.

7237740,0,0,Joe Biden's victory will endanger nation and destroy American greatness: Donald Trump,TikTok booms in Southeast Asia as it picks path through political minefields,"Washington: Seeking another four years in the White House, US President Donald Trump has slammed Democratic rival Joe Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness. 
Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration. 
Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: ""Joe Biden is not the saviour of America's soul."" 
""He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness."" 
""Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history,"" Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate. 
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election. 
""Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs,"" Trump alleged. 
During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). 
Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered. 
""This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" he said. 
""This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades,"" he said. 
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens. 
""And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it,"" he said. 
Referring to the last week's Democrat National Convention, Trump said that Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. 
""So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?"" he asked. 
""In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history,"" he said. 
Trump alleged that for 47 years, Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain - and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands. 
""Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars,"" he alleged. 
""Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defence,"" he said. 
Trump alleged that as vice president Biden supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. 
""He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing (Qasem) Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as ""a positive development"" for America and the world. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win,"" he said. 
""China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused,"" Trump said. 
He called Biden a Trojan horse for socialism. 
""Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden's America,"" he said, referring to violent protests there. 
On November 3, he urged his countrymen to send the Democrats led by Biden a thundering message they will never forget! ""Joe Biden is weak"". 
""He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - At 19, Sandy Saputra is big on TikTok Indonesia. Within a year, he’s leapt from quiet, small-town life to star influencer status as more than 10.5 million followers lap up his toothy grin in dancing, pranking and lip-synching videos on the booming app. 
Sandy’s success, becoming his family’s main breadwinner as global brands like Coca Cola or Suntory pay to have their names on his light-hearted clips, comes as TikTok mushrooms across Southeast Asia. Data trackers show it’s been downloaded hundreds of millions of times already in a region with a collective population of 630 million - half of them under 30. 
But it also comes as concerns over how secure user data is in the hands of its Chinese owner ByteDance summon big storm clouds elsewhere - TikTok has been banned in India and President Donald Trump has ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations, triggering the resignation on Thursday of only recently installed CEO Kevin Mayer. 
Southeast Asia offers a clear view of the global strategy ByteDance is implementing to avoid crackdowns in other regions that influencers like Saputra now fear. The approach is to launch ‘non-political’ products fast, promising to governments in places like Vietnam that content will be tightly policed in accordance with local laws, according to interviews with a dozen current and former employees. 
The region is now key to the future of TikTok and ByteDance: The Chinese firm is already plugging TikTok as part of a suite of interconnected apps for live video streaming, messaging and music, tackling U.S. behemoths Facebook and Google head on as both pour billions into Southeast Asia. 
ByteDance declined to comment for this article, and it’s unclear whether or how the prospective sale of operations in the United States and elsewhere might effect Southeast Asia. But in his base in Sukabumi, West Java province, Saputra is only too aware of risks. 
""Of course I do think about it ... It would be so disappointing if TikTok was erased from Indonesia,"" Saputra told Reuters, speaking before filming a sketch www.tiktok.com/@sandys.ss in a paddy field. 
“It wasn’t planned out. I was an ordinary person, making videos like any other normal person, who didn’t have an idea on how this would play out,” said Saputra, now adding hundreds of thousands of TikTok followers every week. 
SISTER APPS 
In the meantime, TikTok is ploughing ahead testing ‘creator’ marketplaces across the region, championing influencers like Saputra, and negotiating data deals with telecoms firms to keep a lid on consumers’ smartphone bills, according to interviews with current and former staffers. 
It’s chasing small to medium-sized businesses as advertisers - nearly nine out of every 10 firms in Southeast Asia are classified as small - complete with how-to-advertise seminars, millions of dollars in advertising credits, and a self-service platform for businesses to make their own ads. 
TikTok is piloting live-streaming commercial initiatives pioneered in China, Southeast Asia business marketing head Chew Wee Ng said in an interview with Reuters. Meanwhile ByteDance is heavily promoting sister apps like Singapore-headquartered business messaging service Lark and music streaming service Resso. 
“TikTok is really unique in that people expect to see advertisers and they want to co-create with brands,” said Ng, a former Google executive based in Singapore. 
According to data from app analytics firm Sensor Tower, TikTok has had more than 360 millions downloads in Southeast Asia, nearly half of them in Indonesia, with 151% growth year-on-year for 2020. 
An internal ByteDance 2019 presentation reviewed by Reuters showed that last year TikTok had 43.5 million monthly active users in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, with the majority female, the biggest online consumers in the region. 
The app grew staggeringly fast in recent months, sources said, as lockdowns enforced across the region to tackle the coronavirus pandemic forced people to stay home. In Indonesia, Saputra said he’s been acquiring 100,000 followers every three days. 
LOCAL MODERATORS 
With growth has come increased government scrutiny, but ByteDance has already had plenty of experience dealing with that. As on other business matters, ByteDance declined to comment on its handling of scrutiny. 
Indonesia presented one of its first major global policy challenges in 2018, after authorities briefly banned TikTok for posts they said contained “pornography, inappropriate content and blasphemy”. 
Within 24 hours, the firm had dispatched senior executives to negotiate with Indonesia, promising to raise the age of its users and to hire a team of local moderators, according to sources and to the-then Indonesian communications minister. 
It would quickly copy this approach by installing moderators across its Southeast Asian markets in a bid to insure compliance with local laws. 
Reuters reported in August that from 2018 until 2020, ByteDance censored content that it perceived as critical of the Chinese government on a news aggregator app in Indonesia known as BaBe at the behest of ByteDance’s China headquarters. 
As of August 2020, most of the content guidelines have been localised for individual Southeast Asian countries. That has often meant strict censorship of local political content. 
In Thailand, where a youth protest movement is challenging the country’s monarchy, some users told Reuters their pro-protest videos had been taken down. [L4N2FK2IX] 
‘IN VIETNAM, CHINA IS POLITICAL’ 
In Vietnam, TikTok has blocked most political content for years, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company declined to comment. 
Hanoi has been in a long-running conflict with U.S. tech giants over demands to restrict any content deemed against the state and create local offices in Vietnam. 
Reuters reported in April that Facebook agreed to increase censorship of “anti-state” posts in Vietnam after its local servers were temporarily taken off-line. [L3N2CA1L0] 
ByteDance, which unlike big U.S. tech players does have an office in the country, decided to pre-empt issues with the government by promising to make its app ‘non-political’. 
Due to Vietnam’s contentious relationship with China, ByteDance decided it would also ban content critical of Beijing, and anything related to tensions between the two governments. 
“In Vietnam, China is political,” one source said. 
The approach has been effective. TikTok now counts Vietnam, a multi-billion dollar market for social media firms, as among its most profitable in Asia, according to sources with knowledge of the matter, while launching regular campaigns with authorities on safety and tourism. 
Back in West Java, Sandy Saputra aims to keep on flashing grins and goofing around on TikTok. 
“To me, this isn’t a job,” he said, before breaking away into another dance routine. “It’s a hobby that makes money.”

296468,0,0,Explained: Issues in GST compensation,Birthday boy Bottas fastest in opening Belgian GP practice - Reuters UK,"Written by Aanchal Malhotra | New Delhi | 
Published: August 29, 2020 4:00:19 am
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday referred to the Covid-19 outbreak as an act of God that would result in a contraction of the economy in the current fiscal.
With Centre-state friction over pending compensation payments under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) taking a new turn in the 41st GST Council meeting on Thursday, strain on the finances of states is likely to continue in the near term. Several states have opposed the two options to borrow that were proposed in the meeting as a way to bridge the revenue shortfall.
GST compensation payments to states have been pending since April, with the pending amount for April-July estimated at Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The GST compensation requirement is estimated to be around Rs 3 lakh crore this year, while the cess collection is expected to be around Rs 65,000 crore an estimated compensation shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore.
What was discussed at the meeting?
The legal opinion on borrowing was discussed. The opinion of the Attorney General of India was cited to buttress the argument that GST compensation has to be paid for the transition period from July 2017 to June 2022, but the compensation gap cannot be bridged using the Consolidated Fund of India. The AG has suggested the compensation cess levy can be extended beyond five years to meet the shortfall, Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said.
State Finance Ministers, barring a few including those of Assam and Goa, pressed for borrowing by the Centre to bridge the revenue gap. Towards the end of the meeting, the Centre offered two options.
The first was a special window to states, in consultation with the RBI, to borrow the projected GST shortfall of Rs 97,000 crore, and an amount that can be repaid after five years of GST, ending June 2022, from the compensation cess fund. A 0.5% relaxation in the borrowing limit under The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act would be provided, delinked from the conditions announced earlier as part of the pandemic package linked to the implementation of reform measures such as universalisation of One Nation One Ration Card, ease of doing business, power distribution, and augmentation of urban local body revenues.
The second option was to borrow the entire projected shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore both on account of faltering GST collections and the expected shortfall due to the pandemic facilitated by the RBI. No FRBM relaxation has been mentioned for this option so far.
What are the views of the states on these?
Five states and Union Territories Kerala, Punjab, West Bengal, Puducherry and Delhi have voiced their concerns over the proposals.
KERALA: Finance Minister Thomas Isaac said enforcing a cut in compensation and bringing in a distinction between GST and Covid-related revenue loss is unconstitutional. He has said that the states FRBM limit should be raised by at least 1.5 percentage points if the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore has to be borrowed.
PUNJAB: Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal has said these options were thrust upon the states, and the borrowing would translate into mortgaging of the future to live for the present.
DELHI: Deputy CM Manish Sisodia has said the Centres refusal to pay states is the biggest betrayal in the history of federalism in India, and has expressed concerns about Delhis inability to borrow via the RBI to bridge the compensation gap, given its status of a UT with state legislature.
WEST BENGAL: Finance Minister Amit Mitra said borrowing by states will increase their debt servicing liability, and any other interpretation of the compensation-related Section 18 of The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act is unjustifiable. Section 18 of the amendment says Parliament shall, on the recommendation of the GST Council, provide for compensation to states for the loss of revenue arising out of implementation of the GST for five years.
States have asked the Centre for details of the two options. They will then have seven working days to get back with their views.
What is the significance of GST for states?
States no longer possess taxation rights after most taxes, barring those on petroleum, alcohol, and stamp duty, were subsumed under GST. GST accounts for almost 42% of states own tax revenues, and tax revenues account for around 60% of states total revenues.
Finances of over a dozen states are under severe strain, resulting in delays in salary payments and sharp cuts in capital expenditure outlays amid the pandemic-induced lockdowns and the need to spend on healthcare.
The Finance Secretary said GST collections had been severely impacted by the pandemic. Revenues are expected to be hit further; the economy is projected to record a recession this year. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday referred to the Covid-19 outbreak as an act of God that would result in a contraction of the economy in the current fiscal.
When did the issue of compensation to states arise, and how did it evolve?
Shortfall issues surfaced almost a year ago when payments due for August-September 2019 were delayed. Since then, all subsequent payouts have seen cascading delays.
The economic slowdown, which has been on for almost three years now, began to impact GST revenue collections in August 2019. The Centre first admitted to problems on compensation payment in the 37th GST Council meeting in Goa last September it said the amount of cess available in the compensation fund at the end of February shall fall short for payment of compensation for loss of revenue till the bi-monthly period of December-January.
On November 27, 2019, the GST Council wrote to states that the GST and compensation cess collections in the previous few months had become a matter of concern, and that compensation requirements were unlikely to be met.
GST compensation payments had started getting delayed by then. Many state FMs had begun to express concerns over having to repeatedly ask for their share of revenues. The GST compensation payment of Rs 35,298 crore for August-September 2019, which was due in October, was paid in December. The Centre released another Rs 34,053 crore in two instalments in February 2020 and April 2020 as compensation for October-November 2019.
In June this year, Rs 36,400 crore was released as GST compensation for December-February, and the balance Rs 13,806 crore for March was released in July, taking the total compensation payout for FY20 to Rs 1.65 lakh crore.
Under The GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, states are guaranteed compensation for loss of revenue on account of implementation of GST for a transition period of five years (2017-22). The compensation is calculated based on the difference between the states current GST revenue and the protected revenue after estimating an annualised 14% growth rate from the base year of 2015-16.
The high rate of 14%, which has compounded since 2015-16, has been seen as delinked from economic realities. Chairing the first few meetings of the GST Council, then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had proposed a revenue growth rate of 10.6% (the average all-India growth rate in the three years preceding 2015-16). Council meeting records show the suggestion of 14% revenue growth was accepted in the spirit of compromise.

For all the latest Explained News, download Indian Express App.","(Reuters) - Valtteri Bottas set the pace ahead of Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton in Friday’s opening practice session for the Belgian Formula One Grand Prix. 
The Finn, who turned 31 on Friday, lapped the seven km Spa-Francorchamps track in one minute 44.493 seconds, beating Hamilton by just 0.069 seconds on a cool and cloudy morning.  
Max Verstappen was best of the rest again in third for Red Bull. 
The Dutchman, who has a Belgian mother and is missing the support of his army of orange-clad supporters who usually throng the grandstands at Spa, was hot on the Mercedes pair’s heels, ending the session just 0.081 seconds off the pace. 
Hamilton, winner of four of this season’s six races and currently in the form of his life, leads the overall standings by 37 points from Verstappen. 
Bottas, who won the season-opening Austrian Grand Prix in July, is third 43 points behind his team mate.  
With 11 of this season’s 17 races still to run, he needs to start turning the tide if he is to have any hope of denying Hamilton a record-equalling seventh title at the end of the year. 
Sergio Perez was fourth in his Mercedes-inspired Racing Point ahead of Canadian team mate Lance Stroll. 
Alexander Albon, who drove his first race for Red Bull at Spa last year after moving up from junior team Toro Rosso now rebranded Alpha Tauri, was sixth. 
Esteban Ocon, who made his Formula One debut in Belgium in 2016, was seventh for Renault ahead of McLaren’s Carlos Sainz. 
Daniel Ricciardo was ninth in the other Renault with Briton Lando Norris rounding out the top-10 for McLaren. 
Ferrari, winners for the last two years in Belgium, continued to struggle. 
Charles Leclerc, who took his maiden Formula One win at the Spa circuit last year, was only 14th ahead of departing four-time champion Sebastian Vettel in 15th.     
The session was largely uneventful. 
All cars carried special stickers in memory of Frenchman Anthoine Hubert, who suffered fatal injuries in a Formula Two race on the Saturday of the Belgian Grand Prix weekend last year. 
Power unit issues sidelined both Haas cars. Technical issues limited Alfa Romeo’s Antonio Giovinazzi to just two laps.   
Bottas suffered a late-session puncture but returned to the pits without incident.  
When informed about it on the radio he quipped: “I’m getting used to these punctures, I had a puncture last weekend in my road car.”

Ollie Pope missed three months of cricket last summer after dislocating the same shoulder playing for Surrey. (Source: File)England batsman Ollie Pope has been ruled out of action for up to four months with a dislocated left shoulder, the England &amp; Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Friday.
Pope, 22, sustained the injury this week during the third Test against Pakistan in Southampton when he slid to save a boundary. He left the field immediately.
He missed three months of cricket last summer after dislocating the same shoulder playing for Surrey.
The ECB said Pope will undergo surgery in the next couple of weeks before starting his rehabilitation with the Surrey and England medical teams.
It is hoped that Pope will return in time for Englands winter tours of Sri Lanka and India starting in the early part of 2021, it said in a statement.

676942,0,0,Cases per lakh population: Jalandhar tally is more than double of Ludhiana,"Burnes, Holland get nods in Pirates-Brewers opener - Reuters","Written by Navjeevan Gopal
 | Chandigarh | 
Published: August 29, 2020 2:33:55 am
As of August 26, the cases of infection per lakh population in Jalandhar district were more than double of those in Ludhiana. There were 5,817 cases in Jalandhar and 10,147 in Ludhiana. (Representational)Ludhiana may be the district with maximum number of Covid-19 cases in Punjab, but in terms of severity of the pandemic, Jalandhar has emerged as a hotbed of infections, going by the positive cases per lakh population, an analysis of official data has shown.
As of August 26, the cases of infection per lakh population in Jalandhar district were more than double of those in Ludhiana. There were 5,817 cases in Jalandhar and 10,147 in Ludhiana. While Ludhiana had 407.4 cases for every one lakh people, Jalandhar had 976.8 cases.
After Jalandhar, Amritsar, with total positive caseload of 3,612, had the second highest per lakh population cases (584.9).
While 1.37 lakh samples were collected in Ludhiana, in Jalandhar, 74,405 samples were taken, according to the Punjab Covid-19 Status Report till August 26. In Amritsar, a cumulative 77,240 samples were taken for testing.
More testing in Ludhiana explains the maximum total caseload from any district in the state so far, said an official.
Need to increase testing
A government functionary said there was a need to increase testing in other districts also, particularly Jalandhar and Patiala which were witnessing higher cases per lakh population.
The functionary, interestingly, added that there was more testing in Ludhiana because the district had “more tertiary care facilities than other districts”.
The functionary also said that more testing meant lesser fatalities as it helps in early treatment and patient management, a claim which official statistics belie, with highest testing district Ludhiana reporting the highest Covid-19 death toll (363), more than double the fatalities in Amritsar (149) and Ludhiana (148).
Sampling to be doubled in these districts
Punjab Health and Family Welfare Principal Secretary Hussan Lal said, “We are increasing testing in Patiala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar. We have 35 mobile medical units across the state. We are redeploying these units, focusing on these four districts. We are planning to double the sampling in these districts and on Saturday we are having a meeting with field officers. Officials of these districts would be asked if there is any issue in doubling the testing.”
On difference in scale of sampling in districts, especially relatively lesser sampling taking place in districts with higher cases per lakh population, Lal said, “It depends upon how much sampling is taking place and in which particular area. If you have distributed your teams equally in urban and rural areas, then the number of samples would be less. If you push more teams into urban areas, the sampling numbers would be higher since such urban areas are thickly populated.”
As of August 26, as per the Punjab Covid-19 Status Report, a cumulative of 1,37,501 samples were taken in Ludhiana, 77,240 in Amritsar, 74,277 in Patiala, 74,405 in Jalandhar, 62,975 in Gurdaspur district and 52,114 in Hoshiarpur district. In the remaining 16 districts, less than 50,000 samples were taken. And out of those 16 districts, less than 25,000 samples taken with Muktsar district at the bottom with 20,807 cumulative samples taken so far. Muktsar is among the districts where cases have doubled at a faster pace recently. As of Thursday (August 27), the doubling rate of cases in Muktsar was 15 days, as compared to 20 days on August 13.
An official spokesperson of Punjab government on Friday said, “At present, the state government has capacity to conduct 24,000 tests per day and the target is to achieve the milestone of 30,000 tests by next week.
In terms of tests per million of population, as of August 26, Punjab had conducted 31,647 tests per million population, higher than the national average of 28,639, but lesser than seven other states, including neighbouring Haryana (35,148 tests per million of population).

For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App.","The Pittsburgh Pirates and Milwaukee Brewers are set to play baseball Friday at Miller Park, but that doesn’t mean they are overlooking the civil unrest and Black Lives Matter protests that have spread across the country. 
The latest incident to raise voices about social injustice occurred when Wisconsin man Jacob Blake, who is Black, was shot in the back by police in Kenosha last Sunday and reportedly left paralyzed from the waist down. Several sports teams and leagues have postponed games this week. 
The Brewers, in the same state as the unrest in Kenosha, are back on the field after postponing their home game Wednesday against Cincinnati as a show of solidarity. Those teams played a doubleheader Thursday, with the Brewers getting swept. 
Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said the Brewers are taking their lead in social matters from reliever Devin Williams, the only Black player on the club. 
“Devin has been a voice,” Counsell said. “Maybe not publicly, but I know for me he’s been a very important voice. THE most important voice.” 
Pittsburgh, which played a day game Wednesday before other sporting events were postponed, has not missed any games because of the unrest, but the team is remaining aware. 
“The dialog is ongoing,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “It has always been ongoing. We talk about events that happen. The one thing that our group and the Pirates organization wants to make sure we do is continue to learn and to grow and be very thoughtful about what’s going on in the world.” 
For the Pirates, the opener of this four-game series is their fourth game in three days in three cities against a third opponent. They lost to the White Sox in Chicago Wednesday, swept a makeup doubleheader Thursday in St. Louis and now will be in Milwaukee. 
Pittsburgh might not be the most welcome club for the Brewers, who last weekend got swept by the Pirates by a combined 24-11 in the final three games of a road trip. 
The Pirates had won just four games before that sweep, and coming out of that series had four of their seven wins against Milwaukee. Since that series, they lost twice to the White Sox in Chicago before the two games in St. Louis. 
In the opener Friday, Pittsburgh left-hander Derek Holland (1-1, 6.17 ERA) is scheduled to face right-hander Corbin Burnes (0-0, 3.42 ERA). Both starters last pitched in the teams’ series last weekend. 
Holland was the winner Saturday when he gave up one run and four hits in five innings, with three walks and five strikeouts. Overall, he is 2-0 with a 2.01 ERA in 13 career appearances against Milwaukee, four of them starts. 
Burnes was the starter Sunday in Pittsburgh. He got a no-decision, allowing three runs and five hits in 5 1/3 innings with seven strikeouts and two walks. 
“Early on, I just didn’t have my best stuff going,” Burnes said. “Made a few too many mistakes early in the count and they capitalized. ... Just left a few too many pitches in the middle of the zone they got to. After those first two, I kind of settled in there and threw the ball all right.” 
In his career against the Pirates, Burnes is 2-0 with a 3.43 ERA in 13 appearances, with last weekend being his only start against Pittsburgh.

1201588,0,0,CANADA FX DEBT-C$ edges higher vs U.S. dollar after Canada's GDP surges in June - Reuters,Stagflation risks spill over to bond markets: Report,"* Canadian dollar at 1.3094 to the greenback 
* Bond prices higher across the maturity curve (Adds analyst’s comment, updates prices) 
By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed 
Aug 28 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar climbed to a fresh seven-month high against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, on pace for a fourth straight day of gains as the U.S. dollar remained broadly weak and after data showed a record surge in Canada’s real gross domestic product in June. 
The Canadian dollar was at 1.3094 to the greenback, or 76.37 U.S. cents, stronger than Thursday’s close of 1.3123, or 76.20 U.S. cents. 
Canada’s real GDP surged by a record 6.5% in June, as the economy continued to claw back from steep declines in March and April, though economic activity still remained below pre-pandemic levels, Statistics Canada said on Friday. 
Second quarter annualized growth meanwhile sank by a record 38.7%, Statistics Canada said in a preliminary estimate. 
The June numbers were above analyst expectations of a rise of 5.6%, while the second quarter plunge was slightly less sharp than an expected decline of 39.6%. 
“The second-quarter GDP data confirm that the lockdown caused an unprecedented record contraction of 38.7% annualized, but the larger-than-expected rise in GDP in June at least provides a strong handover to the third quarter and means that there will now be a record expansion,” Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. 
The loonie is on track to finish the week up 0.6%, its fourth straight weekly gain. The price of oil, one of Canada’s main exports, was nearly flat on the day but was on pace to end the week about 1.6% higher. 
“With global risk sentiment improving and stability in oil prices, the Canadian dollar has performed well this week,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions. 
Canadian government bond prices were higher across the maturity curve. The two-year yield was at 0.281%, down from 0.297% late on Thursday, while the benchmark Canadian 10-year yield fell to 0.638% from 0.668%. (Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Tom Brown)","MUMBAI: The spike in both inflation print as well as in the benchmark yields indicate that the bond market is in the grip of stagflation, and the higher yields are here to stay, warns a report.
The 10-year G-sec yields have climbed up rapidly by 35 basis points (bps) over the last three weeks, while the July inflation print is 50 bps above the upper end of the Reserve Bank's tolerance level, thus virtually closing the rate cut window in the medium term, a report by Acuite Ratings said on Friday.
The yield differential between two-year and ten-year bonds has again expanded since the monetary stimulus announcement and as on August 24, the differential was over 180 bps, back to the levels seen on April 24.
Moreover, the effective annualised forward rates for a two-year and ten-year zero coupon bonds are substantially higher by 66 bps and 32 bps, respectively, highlighting the market concerns on the longer-term impact of inflation.
""These are early signs of the yield curve adjusting itself to a higher level,"" warns the report.
The spike in bond yields augurs that borrowing costs will go up not only for the government but also for corporates despite ongoing accommodative monetary policy and that open market operations (OMOs) may yield the desired result for the central bank to tame the yields given the twin concerns on inflation and fiscal deficit.
""We believe that the rate cut window is virtually closed in the short-term and there is a significant likelihood of a change in RBI's accommodative policy over the next three to six months particularly if the retail price index doesn't come down, the report said.
The initial trigger for the spurt in the bond yields was the MPC decision to hold the rates, citing the spike in the inflation print on August 6.
Core inflation has actually moved up by 50 bps in July 2020, surprising the market that was expecting the base effect factor to start to moderate inflation in the short-term.
""But such a scenario has enhanced the risks of stagflation, which implies a painful phase of high inflation but low or negative growth, aggravating the challenges currently faced by the policymakers, the report said.
The other significant headwind for the bond yields is the massive spike in fiscal deficit. Although the initial budget estimate projected gross borrowing of Rs 7.9 lakh crore, the same has been hiked by nearly 50 per cent to Rs 12 lakh crore after the pandemic hit the economy and government finances.
And by the second week of August, the government has already borrowed 49 per cent of the revised borrowing estimates or Rs 5.5 lakh crore, taking the gross debt raising to 70 per cent. Similar trends are seen among state debt raising too.
This, the report warns that, also increases the concerns in the market regarding the possibility of higher fiscal deficit, which may double from the budgeted 3.5 per cent.
The higher borrowings will lead to an oversupply of sovereign papers, putting further pressure on the yields. This is more so because most banks hold excess SLR, and the continued participation of the FIIs will be a key factor in stabilising the yields, the report said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/canada-forex-idUSL1N2FU1JG,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/stagflation-risks-spill-over-to-bond-markets-report/articleshow/77810178.cms

The making of a digital circus. (Photo: Arul Horizon)Rambo Circus has opened its colourful tent to the outside world. Without leaving your home, you can watch acrobats perform mind-boggling stunts, trapeze artistes flying overhead, clowns, jugglers, contortionists and giants on stilts.
Rambo, one of Indias biggest and oldest circuses, is fighting back the Covid-19pandemic by taking an hour-long show Life is a circus An Ode to the Greatest Showmanship online. It is, possibly, the first circus in India to do so.
Tickets went on sale on Friday on BookMyShow and streaming will begin September 25. The circus was one of the favourite outings for children and the entire families a few decades ago. Children, especially those born in the 1980s and 1990s, will have fond memories of going to the circus. With isolation becoming the new norm, we are trying to reinvent the experience of watching a circus online for a new generation of children and adults, said Sujit Dilip, owner of Rambo Circus.
For his team of artistes, the transition online was a new experience of performing for cameras instead of crowds, choreographing movements to sounds and lights and, at times, hanging in there for hours until a scene was perfect.
Rambo Circus comprises 60 artistes. Around February-March, 40 people had gone home for Holi, as happens every year, Dilip said. When the pandemic spread through India, and the lockdown was announced (from March 25), many of our artistes were still home. They are sitting idle now. Many circuses have closed down and will never reopen. We are supporting all these artistes, and those from Rambo Circus as well.
Every day, Dilip receives calls from many of these artistes. I hope our online show works out well and we can support our artistes. One of our main problems is that circus artistes are not recognised by the Culture Ministry or any other government department, he said.
The show is scripted as a journey through time, depicted through an array of circus acts — from the founding of the circus by P T Dilip on January 26, 1991, to its struggles, innovations to keep pace with the changing entertainment trends, and achievements such as national and foreign tours. Rambo Circus, Dilip pointed out, has been honoured by Pune Municipal Corporation for its work, and has represented India in World Circus Day Celebration, 2011, at Monte Carlo, where it presented a documentary on the history of Indian circus.
The final scenes will combine the best of acts and will be dedicated to Covid Warriors. A special message from the Rambo Circus artistes will go out to them.
Before the pandemic, the circus was collaborating with a company that was going to help it upgrade. Dilip said he had plans to travel to Russia to look for suitable people and to Italy for technical help on structural designing.
Then the pandemic struck. I could only go to Russia. Our main motto was to improve the standards of the Indian circus. I had invested all my money in research work… he said.
A fundraiser helped raise some money before National Laqshya Live Experiences approached them with the idea to go digital, Dilip said. The planning took place on Zoom for two or three months. It is due to their initiative that we were able to do this online show. The moment the lockdown eased, we started shooting, he said.
Dinesh Shetty, founder, Production Crew Entertainment Pvt Ltd, another collaborator in the project, said they aim to take the age-old circus experience online, with the artistes coming into your homes and making you laugh.
Coming up as soon as the pandemic ends, when people can safely step out for a live experience, is a dream reality that Rambo Circus is working on, Dilip said. It will be a huge technology upgrade with animatronics, projection mapping, 3D and other special effects, he said. The creation will be such that you would feel people are flying. We are on it. The day the government tells us to open, we will need 90-120 days for upgrade. And it will be magic, he promises.

For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App.","(Reuters) - At least 40 dolphins have mysteriously died in an area of Mauritius affected by an oil spill from a Japanese boat, officials and witnesses said on Friday, as a witness described the moment one mother dolphin died in front of him. 
Residents who had ventured out in a boat alerted Reuben Pillay to a mother dolphin swimming around her dying baby. He sped off to try to find them; the baby had died by the time he arrived, he said, but the mother initially looked normal. 
“But in a few minutes she went on her side, one fin in the water, and one out of the water and then she started flapping her tail really really rapidly,” said Pillay, a professional drone operator and environmentalist who is providing video to Reuters. 
“She swam in circles in front of the boat, she moved her tail very violently and after about five minutes she just stopped moving, and she sunk ... We heard cries, I thought it was a woman on the boat - but they told me, no - it was the dolphin.” 
As they watched, the mother stopped moving and eventually slowly sank, tail first, beneath the waves. The body of the baby floated on the surface. 
“We didn’t know what to do. It was heartwrenching,” he said. 
Earlier in the day, Jasvin Sok Appadu from the Mauritius fisheries ministry told Reuters that 38 carcasses had washed up on the beaches so far. 
Autopsy results on 25 dolphins that washed ashore Wednesday and Thursday are expected in the coming days, he said. 
So far veterinarians have examined only two of the dolphins, which bore signs of injury but no trace of hydrocarbons in their bodies, according to preliminary autopsy results. The autopsy on the first two was conducted by the government-run Albion Fisheries Research Centre. 
The dolphins have been dying in an area affected by an oil spill caused when a Japanese ship, the MV Wakashio, struck a coral reef last month. The ship was scuttled on Monday. 
On Thursday, Greenpeace called on the government of Mauritius to launch an “urgent investigation to determine the cause of the deaths and any ties to the Wakashio oil spill”.

297142,0,0,Explained: Issues in GST compensation,Milkbasket plans to launch IPO next year,"Written by Aanchal Malhotra | New Delhi | 
Published: August 29, 2020 4:00:19 am
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday referred to the Covid-19 outbreak as an act of God that would result in a contraction of the economy in the current fiscal.
With Centre-state friction over pending compensation payments under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) taking a new turn in the 41st GST Council meeting on Thursday, strain on the finances of states is likely to continue in the near term. Several states have opposed the two options to borrow that were proposed in the meeting as a way to bridge the revenue shortfall.
GST compensation payments to states have been pending since April, with the pending amount for April-July estimated at Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The GST compensation requirement is estimated to be around Rs 3 lakh crore this year, while the cess collection is expected to be around Rs 65,000 crore an estimated compensation shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore.
What was discussed at the meeting?
The legal opinion on borrowing was discussed. The opinion of the Attorney General of India was cited to buttress the argument that GST compensation has to be paid for the transition period from July 2017 to June 2022, but the compensation gap cannot be bridged using the Consolidated Fund of India. The AG has suggested the compensation cess levy can be extended beyond five years to meet the shortfall, Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said.
State Finance Ministers, barring a few including those of Assam and Goa, pressed for borrowing by the Centre to bridge the revenue gap. Towards the end of the meeting, the Centre offered two options.
The first was a special window to states, in consultation with the RBI, to borrow the projected GST shortfall of Rs 97,000 crore, and an amount that can be repaid after five years of GST, ending June 2022, from the compensation cess fund. A 0.5% relaxation in the borrowing limit under The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act would be provided, delinked from the conditions announced earlier as part of the pandemic package linked to the implementation of reform measures such as universalisation of One Nation One Ration Card, ease of doing business, power distribution, and augmentation of urban local body revenues.
The second option was to borrow the entire projected shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore both on account of faltering GST collections and the expected shortfall due to the pandemic facilitated by the RBI. No FRBM relaxation has been mentioned for this option so far.
What are the views of the states on these?
Five states and Union Territories Kerala, Punjab, West Bengal, Puducherry and Delhi have voiced their concerns over the proposals.
KERALA: Finance Minister Thomas Isaac said enforcing a cut in compensation and bringing in a distinction between GST and Covid-related revenue loss is unconstitutional. He has said that the states FRBM limit should be raised by at least 1.5 percentage points if the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore has to be borrowed.
PUNJAB: Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal has said these options were thrust upon the states, and the borrowing would translate into mortgaging of the future to live for the present.
DELHI: Deputy CM Manish Sisodia has said the Centres refusal to pay states is the biggest betrayal in the history of federalism in India, and has expressed concerns about Delhis inability to borrow via the RBI to bridge the compensation gap, given its status of a UT with state legislature.
WEST BENGAL: Finance Minister Amit Mitra said borrowing by states will increase their debt servicing liability, and any other interpretation of the compensation-related Section 18 of The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act is unjustifiable. Section 18 of the amendment says Parliament shall, on the recommendation of the GST Council, provide for compensation to states for the loss of revenue arising out of implementation of the GST for five years.
States have asked the Centre for details of the two options. They will then have seven working days to get back with their views.
What is the significance of GST for states?
States no longer possess taxation rights after most taxes, barring those on petroleum, alcohol, and stamp duty, were subsumed under GST. GST accounts for almost 42% of states own tax revenues, and tax revenues account for around 60% of states total revenues.
Finances of over a dozen states are under severe strain, resulting in delays in salary payments and sharp cuts in capital expenditure outlays amid the pandemic-induced lockdowns and the need to spend on healthcare.
The Finance Secretary said GST collections had been severely impacted by the pandemic. Revenues are expected to be hit further; the economy is projected to record a recession this year. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday referred to the Covid-19 outbreak as an act of God that would result in a contraction of the economy in the current fiscal.
When did the issue of compensation to states arise, and how did it evolve?
Shortfall issues surfaced almost a year ago when payments due for August-September 2019 were delayed. Since then, all subsequent payouts have seen cascading delays.
The economic slowdown, which has been on for almost three years now, began to impact GST revenue collections in August 2019. The Centre first admitted to problems on compensation payment in the 37th GST Council meeting in Goa last September it said the amount of cess available in the compensation fund at the end of February shall fall short for payment of compensation for loss of revenue till the bi-monthly period of December-January.
On November 27, 2019, the GST Council wrote to states that the GST and compensation cess collections in the previous few months had become a matter of concern, and that compensation requirements were unlikely to be met.
GST compensation payments had started getting delayed by then. Many state FMs had begun to express concerns over having to repeatedly ask for their share of revenues. The GST compensation payment of Rs 35,298 crore for August-September 2019, which was due in October, was paid in December. The Centre released another Rs 34,053 crore in two instalments in February 2020 and April 2020 as compensation for October-November 2019.
In June this year, Rs 36,400 crore was released as GST compensation for December-February, and the balance Rs 13,806 crore for March was released in July, taking the total compensation payout for FY20 to Rs 1.65 lakh crore.
Under The GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, states are guaranteed compensation for loss of revenue on account of implementation of GST for a transition period of five years (2017-22). The compensation is calculated based on the difference between the states current GST revenue and the protected revenue after estimating an annualised 14% growth rate from the base year of 2015-16.
The high rate of 14%, which has compounded since 2015-16, has been seen as delinked from economic realities. Chairing the first few meetings of the GST Council, then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had proposed a revenue growth rate of 10.6% (the average all-India growth rate in the three years preceding 2015-16). Council meeting records show the suggestion of 14% revenue growth was accepted in the spirit of compromise.

Speaking to PTI, Milkbasket co-founder and CEO Anant Goel said the rapid adoption of at-home grocery delivery amongst consumers during the pandemic has provided an impetus to target an initial public offering (IPO) in just a year.
""Milkbasket has a near-perfect record of reaching growth targets since being founded in 2015. The rapid adoption of at-home grocery delivery amongst consumers due to the pandemic has provided us with an impetus to target IPO in just a year, which we had initially planned for the year 2023,"" he said.
Milkbasket, which already offers delivery of over 9,000 products across fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), dairy, fruits and vegetables categories in five cities (Delhi, Noida, Gurugram, Ghaziabad and Bengaluru), currently has an average revenue run rate (ARR) of about USD 100 million.
""We are now working on the process for an IPO... The process takes time and we are still in early stages, but we are looking at possibly next year... second half. For now, the thought process is to list in India, we are an Indian company and well recognised in India,"" he said.
Goel also denied reports of being in talks for selling out the business to Paytm Mall and Reliance Industries.
""These are reports that I also keep reading. We are not looking at getting acquired. Like any other start-up, we are open to investments, but we aren't selling off the business.
""We are seeing strong growth and are scaling it up further. We are EBIDTA-positive already, so whether we receive the funding or not, the IPO plan is on,"" he said.
Goel said the company has seen significant growth in its business over the last few months.
""We are approximately Rs 700 crore-turnover company and we are growing, we should be Rs 1,000 crore in the next couple of quarters,"" he noted.
Milkbasket has raised a total of USD 33 million in equity funding from Inflection Point Ventures, Mayfield India, Beenext, Kalaari Capital, Unilever Ventures, Blume Ventures, Lenovo Capital (LCIG), few family offices, and venture debt funding by Innoven Capital.
Interestingly, Softbank-backed Grofers had also spoken of advancing its plan to launch an initial public offer by the end of next year after its profitability path zoomed during the lockdown period.
Grofers co-founder and CEO Albinder Dhindsa had said the company started making operational profit in January, and expects to become cash positive by the end of this year.
The online grocery delivery segment has gained significant traction amid COVID-19 pandemic. Offline retailers, who have taken a major hit on account of the lockdown, are also keen on partnering with digital platforms to facilitate the delivery of goods.
According to a recent report by Goldman Sachs, India's e-commerce business is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27 per cent to reach USD 99 billion by 2024, with grocery and fashion/apparel likely to be the key drivers of incremental growth.
While, players like Milkbasket, Grofers and BigBasket already compete against giants like Amazon and Flipkart in the segment, the recent entry of Mukesh Ambani's JioMart is set to shake up the segment.
""There has always been competition and that is good. Customers have choice and they can decide whether it is the cheapest item, the best quality, a wide assortment of products or guaranteed delivery (that they want). Entry of JioMart will further expand the market and offer more choice for customers,"" he said.
Goel added that the company caters to a niche segment of customers for all their household needs including everyday essentials like milk.
""The delivery is made every day, customers can place the order till midnight and get it in the morning before 7 AM, and hence never wait for the deliveries. This is a niche yet a huge segment and we definitely lead this,"" he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/gst-council-compensation-states-centreexplained-issues-in-gst-compensation-6574139/,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/milkbasket-plans-to-launch-ipo-next-year-5767391.html

4055219,0,0,UPDATE 1-Death toll of Mauritius dolphins is now 38 - government official - Reuters Africa,Future Enterprises to seal deal with Reliance Retail tomorrow: Report - Livemint,"(Adds background.) 
By Giulia Paravicini 
ADDIS ABABA, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The number of dolphins washed up dead near a Mauritius oil spill site increased to 38 on Friday, a government official told Reuters. 
“I can confirm we have so far found the carcasses of 38 dolphins,” said Jasvin Sok Appadu from the fisheries ministry. 
Autopsy results on 25 dolphins that washed ashore Wednesday and Thursday are expected in the coming days, the official added. 
So far veterinarians have examined only two of the dolphins, which bore signs of injury but no trace of hydrocarbons in their bodies, according to preliminary autopsy results. 
The oil spill was caused by a Japanese ship that struck a coral reef on July 25 and began to spill oil about a week later. The ship was scuttled on Monday. 
The autopsy on the first two was conducted by the government-run Albion Fisheries Research Centre. 
Greenpeace called on Thursday on the government of Mauritius to launch an “urgent investigation to determine the cause of the deaths and any ties to the Wakashio oil spill”. 
Environmentalists and scientists have warned about a major ecological disaster and said that the impact on Mauritius and its tourism-dependent economy could last for decades. (Reporting by Giulia Paravicini; Editing by Toby Chopra and Alison Williams)","India's Future Enterprises Ltd is all set to finalise the sale of the group's retail business to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd's retail arm on Saturday, The Economic Times said.The deal, reportedly in the works for months now, has been valued at about 29,000- 30,000 crore, according to various media reports. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, The Economic Times said on Friday that Reliance will take on Future Group's debt and liabilities and pick up a minority stake in its consumer arm.
Owned by India's ""father of modern retailing"", Kishore Biyani, Future Group is home to supermarket chain Big Bazaar, upmarket food stores Foodhall, and bargain clothing chain Brand Factory.
The Group will merge five listed units across grocery, apparel, supply chain and the consumer business into Future Enterprises, which will then hive off all retail assets and sell them to Reliance as a single unit, the report said.
Future Group and Reliance did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for a comment.
Future Enterprises had said earlier this week it would meet on Saturday to consider proposals to raise funds through an issue of bonds.
Led by Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani, Reliance has been diversifying its business and ramping up a retail presence. It launched an online grocery service JioMart in May, a move rivalling Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc Ltd's Flipkart in India, a key growth market for e-commerce.
The company is also in talks to buy online furniture company Urban Ladder and milk delivery startup Milkbasket to strengthen its e-commerce business, The Times of India had said earlier this month.
Shares in Future Enterprises Ltd jumped 5% and hit an upper price limit.

6013101,0,0,Taiwan's Mediatek pushes for permission to supply Huawei after U.S. curbs - Reuters,View: The likely Harris impact on Indo-US ties,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwanese chip designer Mediatek Inc (2454.TW) said on Friday it had applied to the U.S. government for permission to continue supplying China’s Huawei after new U.S. curbs take effect in mid-September amid rising China-U.S. tensions. 
The Trump administration in August expanded its curbs on Huawei and banned suppliers from selling chips made using U.S. technology to the Chinese firm without a special licence. 
MediaTek, which analysts said could be among the worst affected following the latest curbs, said it will follow related global trade regulations and has applied for the permission to ship to Huawei after Sept. 15. 
Reporting By Yimou Lee; editing by David Evans","By Archana Chaudhary and Ganesh NagarajanPlacards lining the road into Kamala Harriss ancestral family village in southern India display her photograph with the caption Singa Pennae, or Lioness.
The phrase from a female power ballad in a popular Tamil movie released last year signaled the excitement in some parts of India over her nomination as the Democratic vice presidential candidate on a ticket with Joe Biden. Her family is confident that Harris, the first Black and Indian-American woman on a major presidential party ticket, will win over the rest of a country that has moved closer to the US thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modis close ties with Donald Trump.
Indians love drama, which explains President Trumps popularity in India, said Harriss maternal uncle, Gopalan Balachandran, an academic based in New Delhi. But I am confident that she will be equally popular.
Forged by theatrics, the Trump-Modi bond culminated in two giant stadium events in front of tens of thousands of their supporters one in Houston last September and the other in Gujarat in February. And while the warming relations have not yet resolved a trade spat, India has expanded arms purchases from the US and aligned with it more openly against China.
The Trump administration has made India a key part of its Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy, and backed Modis government following deadly clashes between Chinese and Indian troops along their disputed Himalayan border in June. India is also a key part of the informal regional grouping to counter China known as the Quad, which also includes the US, Japan and Australia.
Still, the closer ties between the US and India are likely to persist in a Biden-Harris White House, said Amitabh Mattoo, a former member of Indias National Security Council Advisory Board.
They may not roll out a red carpet or give bear hugs or talk about each other in narcissistic terms, but I dont think there will be substantial shift in the importance that Washington has for India that will remain, said Mattoo, the author of more than a dozen books on international relations and a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Biden is unlikely to do anything reckless in terms of changing posture as long as the China threat remains.
A spokesman for the Biden-Harris campaign referred to Bidens plan to place a high priority on continuing to strengthen the US-India relationship. The campaign declined to comment further.
Frayed NervesIndia-US ties have advanced under previous Democratic administrations. In March 2000, President Bill Clinton looked past Indias nuclear tests to begin developing a stronger bilateral relationship. Under the George W. Bush administration, Biden helped pilot the civil nuclear cooperation with India in the Senate as chair of the foreign relations committee.
And though relations soured after the arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York in 2013, Barack Obama mended ties soon after Modis election. The leaders sat for hours together in the rain as Obama become the first US president to be the official chief guest at Indias Republic Day parade.
Trump has hit India on trade while avoiding more controversial issues. While in New Delhi in February, Trump said hed raised the issue of religious freedom with Modi, but declined to comment on demonstrations against the governments new citizenship law discriminating against Muslims. Hes also offered to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir after Modi ended decades of autonomy in Indias only Muslim-majority state.
Harris has expressed more concern about Modis actions, which has led to a lengthy crackdown in Kashmir and nationwide street protests earlier in the year over the citizenship law.
We have to remind Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world, Harris said in September 2019 while on the campaign trail. We are keeping track of the situation. There is a need to intervene if the situation demands. A Biden campaign policy paper outlining his outreach toward Muslim Americans criticized India over Kashmir and the citizenship law, while in a statement released earlier this month he said he would stand by India in confronting the threats it faces along its borders.
Strategic RelationsDespite those issues, BJP said the US and India have deep strategic relations supported widely across party lines in both countries.
As far as the BJP is concerned, we are naturally happy that someone with Indian ancestry is contesting the second topmost post in USA, Vijay Chauthaiwale, chief of foreign affairs in the party who helped organize the Namaste Trump event in Gujarat in February, said in a text message.
Bidens campaign has pledged reform the H-1B visa system and work to eliminate the country-quota for green cards, both issues that are important to the increasingly influential Indian American community. And observers expect him to go easier on trade issues than Trump.
While Harris Indian heritage will no doubt be a positive element in her approach to India, the more important bit is that the administration will not be as publicly harsh on trade and visas, said Arun K Singh, a former Indian ambassador to the US.
Indians form about a fifth of 20 million Asian Americans and are often more educated and earn more than other immigrant groups, the Washington-based Pew Research Center found. About 65% of Indian Americans were Democrats or leaned toward the Democrats, according to a 2014 Pew Research paper.
Politics was a frequent topic of discussion in the Harris family home in India, said Sarala Gopalan, Kamalas aunt, who said the vice presidential candidate is very close to her relatives. Gopalan, one of the Chitthis Harris referred to in her acceptance speech, said the village offered prayers at a local temple when her candidacy was announced.
My father was working for the government, my mother was very much interested in politics, Gopalan, 76, said. She had politics in her blood.

773083,0,0,"Donald Trump promises Covid-19 vaccine by end of this year, or sooner",NASA Created Fifth State Of Matter Inside The International Space Station,"US President Donald Trump vowed to ""crush"" Covid-19 with a vaccine by the end of the year, as he accepted the Republican nomination for a second term as the country's leader. The US President said that the country is roped in deft scientist to develop the vaccines for coronavirus under 'Operation Warp Speed'.
""We are marshaling America's scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time. We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year and together we will crush the virus,” Trump said, adding that three cvaccines will be ready for production soon and could be made available this year.
Trump said, “We are getting our scientists to develop vaccines under 'Operation Warp Speed'. We have 3 vaccines that will be available for production soon and they will be available this year.” He also said the US has conducted the highest number of Covid-19 tests, 40 million, much more than any other country with India being the second largest.
Trump, in his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention which re-nominated him as the Republican Party's presidential candidate, said that the US has conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation which is India.
“We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma,” he said on Thursday night.
“You saw that on Sunday night when we announced that we'll save thousands and thousands of lives. Thanks to advances, we have pioneered the fatality rate. And you look at it and you look at the numbers, it has been reduced by 80 per cent since April,” he said.

Trump delivered his speech to a group of over 1,000 supporters on the South Lawn of the White House. Many did not wear face masks and were seated close together.
The US is among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world, Trump said.
“The European Union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours, but you don't hear that. They don't write about that. They don't want to write about that. They don't want you to know those things.
“All together, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30 per cent greater increase and excess mortality than the United States,” said the president.
In recent months, the United States and the world has been hit by the once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe.
“They could have stopped it but they allowed it to come out. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude,” he said.
Criticising his Democratic Party rival Joe Biden, Trump said unlike the former vice president, his administration focuses “on the science, the facts and the data” to handle the coronavirus pandemic. “If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.,,,,"" Trump, who had earlier dismissed the pandemic as not a major health issue for the country, said.
Many Americans, including him, sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease, Trump said.
“As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that had been so tragically taken. So unnecessary.
“In their honour, we will unite. In their memory, we will overcome. And when the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilisation since World War II. Invoking the Defence Production Act, we produced the world's largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator which is a miracle,” Trump added.
More than 180,000 people have died from the coronavirus pandemic since the start of the outbreak in the US, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
Nearly 5.8 million cases have also been confirmed nationwide, making America the worst-hit country in the world after the disease emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year.
Trump repeatedly claimed there would be a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, and also implied it could be available sooner.
“We are delivering life-saving therapies, and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner,” Trump said at one point.
“We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before.
“Nobody thought it could ever be done this fast. We are producing them in advance, so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available,"" Trump said.
“We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year,” Trump assured, “and together we will crush the virus.” ""Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticise,"" Trump said.
""When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died,"" he said.
According to the India's Union Health Ministry data, India's COVID-19 tally stands at 33,87,500 while the death toll at 61,529.

In this state, atoms act like a wave instead of individual particles. NASA has repeatedly managed to achieve this state of matter aboard the International Space Station (ISS).
The breakthrough was achieved by NASAs Cold Atom Laboratory atop the ISS back in 2018 for the first time. This was also the first time that this state of matter was achieved in the lower Earth orbit.
In a recent video, NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory highlights the advantages of creating this state of matter in space. The video also sheds light on how the US space agency is able to achieve this state in space.

Called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), the unique state of matter was first achieved by scientists more than 25 years ago. The BEC is known to have extraordinary properties which are totally unlike solids, liquids, gases and plasmas. At the time of its discovery, the achievement garnered a Nobel Prize and changed physics as we know it for the generations to come.
BECs are used to make headway in quantum mechanics, the branch of physics that focuses on the behaviors of atoms and subatomic particles. Quantum mechanics is an integral part of many components in many modern technologies. An example of this is how cell phones and computers employ the wave nature of electrons in silicon.
Less challenges aboard the ISS

The Cold Atom Laboratory or the CAL aboard the ISS is a physics user facility. As per NASA, CAL produces clouds of ultra-cooled atoms (BECs), chilled to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. This temperature is even colder than the average temperature of deep space.
Through this method, the atoms in a BEC demonstrate quantum characteristics at relatively large size scales, allowing a better understanding to researchers. Such a production of BECs aboard the ISS has some advantages over their production on Earth.
A big challenge on Earth, for instance, is that these freely evolving BECs are dragged down by the pull of gravity. So as soon as they are produced, they fall quickly to the floor of the chamber. This allows scientists only a fraction of a second to observe them.
The microgravity environment of the space station avoids this, as each freely evolving BEC can be observed for up to 10 seconds, which is longer than whats possible with any other existing BEC experiment, says NASA. Within CAL, researchers have up to 6.5 hours of such experimentation time available each day.

""With Cold Atom Lab, scientists can see their data in real time and make adjustments to their experiments on short notice,"" said Jason Williams, a member of the Cold Atom Lab science team at JPL. ""That flexibility means we're able to learn quickly and address new questions as they arise.""
Another big plus of producing BECs in CAL is that the facility in space is able to reach colder temperatures than Earth-bound laboratories. One way to reach such temperatures is to simply make the ultracold atom clouds slowly expand. The expansion causes the atoms to get even cooler. It is also easier to do in space as there is no gravity pulling atoms to the ground.
Now producing BECs for the last two years, CAL successfully concises the technology in massive structures on Earth into a small box-like structure. With experiments being conducted in it everyday, it is only a matter of time before the device is responsible for a major breakthrough.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/donald-trump-promises-covid-19-vaccine-by-end-of-this-year-or-sooner-120082900089_1.html,https://www.indiatimes.com/technology/news/nasa-fifth-state-of-matter-international-space-station-521438.html
3271819,0,0,India's area under kharif crops hits all-time high of over 108 mn hectares,"UPDATE 1-Kenya Airways losses deepen, expects more challenges ahead - Reuters Africa","Sowing of kharif crops touched an all-time high area of 108.22 million hectares during the week ended August 28, raising hopes of a bumper harvest in excess of 149 million tonnes during the season.
 The last all-time high kharif acreage was in the kharif season of 2016, at 107.57 million hectares .
 A good kharif output could help tame overall retail inflation within the Reserve bank of India’s threshold band of 2-6 per cent in the months to come. Retail inflation since April has been hovering at 7 per cent largely due to high food prices.
 A question mark also remains on the demand to absorb this surplus production, and unless it picks up strongly in the months to come crop prices might collapse, hurting farmers immensely.
 Meanwhile, the area data showed that this year’s acreage of 108.22 million hectares is so far about 7.15 per cent more than that under kharif crops last year and 1.5 per cent beyond the average acreage of the past five years.

 “Sowing of rice is still continuing in some parts, while sowing of pulses, coarse cereals, bajra and oilseeds is almost over. We are confident that with so much acreage, over total foodgrains production in 2020-21 will cross the targeted 298.32 million tonnes,” agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said in a statement today.
 Though, agriculture ministry officials are confident of a bumper harvest due to record increase in kharif acreage, but experts and farmers said the on-ground situation in some crops is not that encouraging as incessant rains since the last few weeks and pest attack could impact the final yield particularly in early sown varieties.
 Like in Madhya Pradesh, state officials and traders are now saying that the main kharif crop of soybean could be atleast 10-15 per cent less than last year due to the massive stem fly attack.
 Similarly, in some parts of Central and Western India, the incessant rains since the early August could impact the final yield of pulses and oilseeds crops in those parts where the crop is submerged for an abnormally longer duration of time.
 Meanwhile, according to a preliminary assessment by the Indore-based Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA), the attack by pests such as stem fly might lead to 10-12 per cent drop in production in the state, but much will depend on the weather in the coming weeks.
 SOPA based its assessment on a survey conducted recently. 
It said the most affected districts are Indore, Dewas, Ujjain, Dhar, Sehore, Harda, Shajapur, Mandsaur and Neemuch in MP, although some damage is seen at other places also.
 Last week, SOPA estimated that India's soybean production could jump by 32per cent in 2020 to 12.25 million tonnes from a year earlier due to higher area under the oilseed and increased yields on ample monsoon rainfall.
 For Madhya Pradesh, it had estimated a 11.5 per cent rise in production to 5.8 million tonnes in 2020.
 After, the latest announcement, the actual production in 2020 could be much near last year’s level 5.2 million tonnes in MP.

 Though farmers and agriculture department officials have fanned out in the fields to control the pests, scientists said it is very difficult to revive the crop in those parts where the stem fly pest has already entered the shoot. Stem fly usually attacks if there is a long break in monsoon. Farmers said the sudden break in rains in July after the strong onset and progress in June has created perfect breeding grounds for the pest.
 “The stem fly attack in some soybean crop in Madhya Pradesh is among the severest in recent times and is largely due to sudden drop in moisture levels in the soil in the crucial growth month of July,” J K Kanojia, head of Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Sehore (MP) told Business Standard.
 The southwest monsoon in 2020 till August 28 is almost nine per cent more than normal. The rains, which were nearly 10 per cent below normal in July, picked up pace strongly thereafter and till a few weeks back, August rains were 24 per cent above normal.","(Adds detail, background)

NAIROBI, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Kenya Airways on Friday reported a first-half pretax loss of 14.36 billion shillings ($133 million) as COVID-19 prompted months of suspended travel, slashing its revenue. 
The loss widened from a shortfall of 8.56 billion shillings a year earlier. 
The airline warned its full-year results will also be affected as air travel demand is expected to be less than half that of 2019 for the rest of 2020. 
Kenya Airways, in which Air France KLM holds a small stake, said revenue fell 48% to 30.21 billion shillings while passenger numbers were down 56% to 1.1 million. 
Passenger revenue was down 53% to 20.23 billion shillings. 
“Faced with long recovery prospects, diminishing revenue occasioned by reduced demand in passenger business and increased costs due to tight health and safety measures, the business focus for the rest of 2020 will be ensuring the survival and rebound (of) the company,” the carrier said in a statement. 
It resumed domestic flights in mid-July after the government cleared local air travel, and international flights were restarted on Aug. 1. 
It said its operating costs fell 37% to 38.63 billion shillings during the period. 
The airline was struggling long before the coronavirus outbreak, posting a 2019 loss of almost 13 billion shillings. 
In July, the Nairobi Securities Exchange suspended trading of Kenya Airways shares for three months, citing the government’s plan to restructure the carrier, after it submitted to parliament a draft law on nationalising the airline. 
In the same month, Kenya Airways said it would lay off an unspecified number of number of workers, reduce its network and offload some assets. 
It said in August so far it had laid off some 650 people. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has grounded much of the global aviation industry, with African airlines expected to lose $6 billion in revenue this year. 
Kenya Airways said in June that between January and June it lost about $100 million in revenue and that the figure was expected to grow to between $400 and $500 million this year. 
$1 = 108.2000 Kenyan shillings

595609,0,0,U.S. state election officials say little evidence of absentee ballot fraud - Reuters,"Oil steady as US producers, refiners avoid worst of Hurricane Laura","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top election officials from two states told Congress on Friday they have seen little evidence of absentee ballot fraud in U.S. primary elections this year and do not expect it to be a big issue in the November general election. 
President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that a rise in mail-in voting will lead to a rise in fraud, though he has expressed more openness to absentee voting, which is the way he has cast ballots. 
Authorities in Michigan, a swing state that Trump won in 2016 but polls suggest he could lose in 2020, so far this year have found “zero evidence of fraud or irregularities,” the state’s top election official, Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, told the House Committee on Homeland Security. 
Michael Adams, secretary of state in solidly Republican Kentucky, said voting in his state’s June primary election likewise was clean of fraud. 
Asked whether he had seen evidence of outside forces, such as foreign governments, seeking to interfere in this year’s elections, Adams said Kentucky authorities sensed some “rattling on our doorknobs,” but offered no details. 
Benson said likewise her state had encountered some evidence of foreign attempts at election interference, but also did not offer details. 
To make absentee voting more secure and accessible, Benson said Michigan will deploy 1,000 “drop boxes” across the state where voters can directly deposit their absentee ballots for subsequent counting by election officials. 
Adams said in Kentucky, Republican voters expressed the most enthusiasm for drop boxes, and he said more drop boxes would be deployed for the November election but would be kept under “continuing surveillance” to ensure against fraud.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday as a massive storm raced inland past the heart of the U.S. oil industry in Louisiana and Texas without causing any widespread damage to refineries.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 3 cents, or 0.1%, to $43.01 a barrel as of 0409 GMT.
WTI is on track to rise 1.6% rise this week, for a fourth straight week of gains.
Brent crude futures for October, set to expire on Friday, rose 2 cents to $45.11 a barrel, heading for a 1.7% weekly gain. The more active November contract climbed 3 cents to $45.63.
""With the U.S. Gulf hurricanes out of the way and preliminary assessment showing no damage to the upstream or downstream facilities, crude has surrendered most of the storm premium and could enter a holding pattern again,"" said Vandana Hari, oil market analyst at Vanda Insights.
Hurricane Laura hit Louisiana early Thursday with winds of 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour), damaging buildings, knocking down trees and cutting power to more than 650,000 people in Louisiana and Texas, but refineries were spared from feared massive flooding.
But investors are shifting their concerns from production outages to demand destruction, analysts said.
""Crude prices have barely budged this week, but refining margins have been hammered as flash floods disrupt normal consumption patterns, likely for a longer period of time than (Gulf of Mexico) production remains offline,"" said RBC Capital in a note.
U.S. producers had shut 1.56 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude output, or 83% of the Gulf of Mexico's production, while nine refineries had shut around 2.9 million bpd of capacity, or 15% of U.S. processing capacity, ahead of the storm.
Late on Thursday, the Port of Houston, the top U.S. crude oil export hub accounting for about 600,000 bpd of shipments, was in the process of reopening to commercial shipping late Thursday.
The earlier closures of Houston Port, Beaumont and Port Arthur were expected to reduce seaborne crude export capacity by nearly 1 million bpd, data intelligence firm Kpler estimated, based on average figures over the past four months.
In refining, Motiva Enterprises is preparing to restart its 607,000 bpd refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, the largest in the U.S., on Friday and Exxon Mobil Corp was preparing to restart units at its 369,024 bpd Beaumont, Texas refinery.

2923519,0,0,"COVID strikes IPL: Chennai Super Kings player, multiple staff members test positive",Easybuy ties-up with Amazon to scale up value fashion as shoppers turn frugal,"New Delhi: A current India cricketer is among multiple members of the Chennai Super Kings contingent who have tested positive for COVID-19, forcing the IPL franchise to extend its quarantine period in Dubai and causing upheaval ahead of the event starting September 19. 
The franchise is yet to issue a formal statement but a league source told that the number of positive cases could be between 10 and 12. 
""Yes, a right-arm medium fast bowler, who has recently played for India in white-ball cricket, along with a few staff members have tested positive for COVID-19. The number could be as high as 12,"" the senior IPL source said on conditions of anonymity. 
The development has forced the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side to extend the quarantine period till September 1. 
While there is panic in the BCCI's rank and file after this but it is understood that for the time being, there is no imminent threat to the league, shifted out of India this year due to the pandemic. 
The source revealed that all COVID-19 positive results came during day 1, 3 and 6 of testing after the contingent's arrival in Dubai. 
""As far as we know, one of the senior-most officials of the CSK management, an official's wife, and at least two members of their social media team are also COVID-19 positive,"" he said. 
According to the BCCI's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), all those who test positive are mandated to go through an additional seven-day quarantine. 
They can enter the bio-secure bubble only after returning negative in tests to be conducted after the extended isolation. 
It is understood that all the members of the jumbo contingent, who tested positive, are ""largely asymptomatic"". 
The biggest challenge will be tracing those who came in contact with these contingent members as it is understood that most of them contracted the virus in Chennai, where the team had a short training camp before heading to Dubai. 
""If you see, they all had tested negative for COVID during the two RT-PCR tests conducted in Chennai ahead of their departure. Had they been positive, they wouldn't have been able to board the flight in the first place,"" the league source stated. 
It is understood those who have tested negative will be allowed to enter the bio-bubble. However, the IPL source believes that the likelihood of the team's camp starting on September 1 is slim. 
""I don't think they can start the camp from September 1. It will take at least till September 5 before they can even think of resuming the camp,"" he said. 
In the BCCI corridors, there was bewilderment over the team's decision to have a camp in Chennai before boarding the flight to Dubai. Tamil Nadu has recorded more than 4 lakh cases so far. 
""CSK practised three days in Chennai out of the five days. Was there any tangible gain achieved from that camp?"" a BCCI official said. 
It remains to be seen what protocols will be followed for all those players who will be arriving late after the conclusion of the Caribbean Premier League and the England vs Australia limited-over series. 
It couldn't be confirmed whether BCCI will be coming out with an official release on the issue confirming the name of the player and staff members. 
Earlier, Rajasthan Royals' fielding coach Dishant Yagnik had returned positive in tests conducted in India.","New Delhi: Landmark Group-promoted value fashion brand Easybuy that retails affordable fashion apparel in India's small towns and cities has partnered with online retailer Amazon to sell clothes as consumers scrimp on discretionary expenses and increasingly skip store visits to shop from e-commerce platforms.The two fast-tracked their plans for a tie-up that will see Easybuy sell specially curated inventory and online-only brands on Amazon.
Covid-19 has prompted several households in India to shop online for the first time, helping them experiment across categories such as grocery, staples, apparel and electronics. A recent report by the Boston Consulting Group estimated that 20% new users have been added to the universe of online shopping in India in the last three to four months.
Some of these shoppers are likely to stick around even when the fear of infections eases out.
We have fast-tracked the plan as we see the market is fast moving online,"" said Anand Aiyer, senior vice-president and business head, Easybuy. We are looking at distribution and reach. With covid, the timing was perfect because a lot of consumer trends and behaviours are changing to online and I think we have launched at the right time. We wanted to first strengthen our brick and mortar,"" Aiyer said.
Over the next six months, the offline collection will be brought online through a store fulfillment programme. Amazon will sell Easybuys tops, t-shirts, dresses, jeans, trousers, shirts, kids-wear priced between 69 to 699.
Easybuy was started in 2017 by Dubai-based Landmark Group to sell fashion to Indias value-conscious shoppers and has close to 100 stores in India. Landmark Group also owns value retailer Max in India, apart from Lifestyle department stores and Home Centre.
With fewer occasions to socialize and office-goers still working remotely, for fashion retailers, this has also meant that shoppers are now buying more causal wear, while postponing pricey buys. ""In the current situation, we can definitely see that the consumer is now moving to value formats. This has really helped us in terms of traction compared to all other formats that Landmark has in India,"" said Aiyer.
""The nature of demand has changed but it hasn't taken away demand for clothing,"" said Mayank Shivam, director, strategic initiatives, Amazon Fashion India.
Earlier this week, furniture retailer IKEA announced plans to reduce prices across its range of popular selling bookshelves, sofas, kitchen items in India to drive accessibility. The changing customer mindset with the pandemic has made affordability more relevant. And this situation makes it even more important for us to be able to live up to meet todays reality,"" Kavitha Rao, country commercial manager, IKEA India, said in a statement.
Furniture retailer Godrej Interio, too, said it will launch a budget range of furniture for people who are spending more time at home.
Amazon's move comes after rival Flipkart, owned by American retailer Walmart, announced plans to invest 260 crore to pick up a minority stake in Arvind Fashions Ltds (AFL) recently created subsidiary Arvind Youth Brands, which owns denim brand Flying Machine,as it plans to reach more shoppers in India's smaller cities.
More retailers are trying to fulfill demand for shoppers in India's smaller cities where a lack of large brands and organized retail chains makes it easy for them to shop online. Over the last 2-3 years, we (Amazon Fashion) are increasingly seeing that more than 60-65% of our customers today are from tier II and III and smaller towns,"" said Shivam.

1769297,0,0,Minister invites suggestions for ‘people-centric’ science and tech policy - Hindustan Times,Redmi 9 Prime review: Another contender in the budget phone segment,"To ensure a wide-ranging consultation process for the country’s fifth science, technology and innovation policy (STIP 2020), the union science minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday inaugurated an interactive session with thought leaders and a web portal seeking inputs from people. The minister urged the stakeholders and the people of the country as well as those living abroad to participate in the process of developing the bottom-up policy to support the rapidly changing science, technology and innovation ecosystem. 
“The entire science, technology and innovation ecosystem has undergone rapid transformation in terms of relevance, scope, and scale in the recent years. These must be captured into a policy to develop a long development trajectory and vision for the country. Moreover, Covid-19 has introduced some new learning and added dimensions to the STI system,” he said. 
With the Prime Minister calling for an Atmanirbhar Bharat, the minister said that there was a greater need to focus on the development of indigenous technologies and encourage grassroots level innovation. 
“For the last six years, the departments of sciences have been working on enhancing the quality and relevance of science and technology, translating the science to innovation that will reach the society, connecting the whole ecosystem – academia, industry, start-ups, and aligning science to national priorities. Currently, Covid-19 and other areas such as water, energy, waste processing are challenges of the future. STIP 2020 will be an overarching policy to guide this,” said Prof Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, department of science and technology in the first ‘in conversation with’ series. 
The STIP 2020 will follow the core principles of being decentralised, evidence-informed, bottom-up, experts-driven, and inclusive. 
“India’s first science policy came in 1958 that focussed on promoting a scientific temperament in the country, the second one in 1983 came when India was denied technologies after Pokhran and aimed at making the country technologically self-reliant, the third came in 2003 and for the first time focussed on connecting science and technology to the society. The fourth policy came in 2013 during the international decade of innovation,” said Dr Akhilesh Gupta, head of the STIP secretariat. 
“Although the last two had some bottoms up approach and wider consultations, the 2020 policy will be completely decentralised and focus on the five core principles or the pillars,” he said. 
The STIP 2020 formulation policy has been divided into four interlinked tracks. Track-I involves extended public and expert consultation and creates a repository of voices; Track-II will focus on experts-driven thematic group consultations for evidence-informed recommendations. For this, 21 thematic groups with over 150 experts have already been constituted. Track-III connects ministries, departments, and States/UTs to create regional ecosystems and action plans. Track-IV will integrate inputs from all the tracks and engage stakeholders at national and global levels. 
“In the new policy, people will need to contribute. It has to be people centric – look around us and discuss with people how to best use science and tech to find solutions to their problems. Even a layman can sometimes give the best of solutions. The policy will help us in blending research and development with indigenous thinking. There are already so many things delivered within labs but in the journey from labs to industry and to the people at affordable prices there are bottlenecks,” said Harsh Vardhan.","Redmi 9 Prime is an excellent performer under Rs 10,000. (Express Photo: Karanveer Singh Arora)Redmi 9 Prime marks the return of the Prime suffix for Xiaomi. The company reasons it has made a phone that offers a lot more in terms of specs for the sub-Rs 10,000 price tag, and this justifies the Prime branding. But even as it loaded the phone with high spec components, did Xiaomi have to cut corners?
Here is our review.
Xiaomi Redmi 9 Prime Price: Rs 9,999 (4GB RAM/64GB storage) | Rs 11,999 (4GB RAM/128GB storage)
Xiaomi Redmi 9 Prime Specifications: 6.53-inch full HD+ display | MediaTek Helio G80 processor | 4GB RAM | 64GB/128GB internal storage | 13MP + 8MP ultra wide angle lens + 5MP macro lens + 2MP depth sensor quad-camera setup on the back | 8MP front camera | 5,020mAh battery | MIUI 11 based on Android 10 |
What could make you buy the Redmi 9 Prime?
Design
The Redmi 9 Prime features a plastic build, which is what you get in this price bracket. And for some, it is a very good choice of material considering that the device can take a beating without you worrying it about having a cracked back glass. A textured finish has been added to the back to make it feel a bit premium in hand.
The camera module looks unique, with a triple camera array and a capacitive fingerprint sensor inside of one module and a separate module for the fourth camera sensor and the LED flash. All of these sensors are located inside of a circular ring, similar to the Poco X2. Apart from the textured back and the camera module, the phone feels pretty minimalist from the back.
 The Redmi 9 Prime features a plastic build, which is what you get in this price bracket. (Express Photo: Karanveer Singh Arora)Coming to the front, the phone does feature a dated notch, but the bezels are one of the smallest I have seen in this price bracket. The top edge features an IR blaster, which helps you control home appliances like the TV and the AC. The feature is not given much weight, but it comes in handy a lot more than you think. Two more design features I like are located on the bottom edge, the first one being a Type-C port and the other being the 3.5mm headphone jack.
Lastly, the phone is offered in Matte Black, Mint Green, Space Blue and Sunrise Flare colour options. I had the Sunrise Flare variant for review, but I would have preferred any of the Matte Black, Mint Green or the Space Blue variants, instead.
Display
The display is another key factor that would push people towards the Redmi 9 Prime, as it is among the handful of devices in this price range to feature a full HD+ display. And as an add-on, the device features Gorilla Glass 3 protection on top.
 The touch response rate is quite fast allowing you to navigate the UI smoothly. (Express Photo: Karanveer Singh Arora)The 6.53-inch display is large enough to watch any sort of content and is bright enough for most scenarios. However, sometimes under direct sunlight, the display backlight does not seem that bright, making you cover it with your hand to read. The touch response rate is quite fast allowing you to navigate the UI smoothly.
Fingerprint and Face Unlock
The device features a capacitive fingerprint sensor on the back, which is ample fast and accurate. I never during my time with the phone faced any issues with the fingerprint sensor.
 Redmi 9 Prime’s capacitive fingerprint sensor is plenty fast. (Express Photo: Karanveer Singh Arora)Face Unlock is also very fast and does not open up when your eyes are closed. However, the device uses 2D data to enable the feature. This means the device captures your photo during registration and compares it with your current face. This is a bit insecure compared to the other unlock options.
Performance
Redmi 9 Prime is a good phone if you are looking to perform light multi-tasking and performing daily tasks like calling, browsing the web, checking your social media handles, casual gaming and more.
During our multi-tasking test, the device performed quite well showing no stutters while having 14 apps open at one time and having 27 tabs open inside of Chrome. Shifting between apps and the tabs at frequent intervals did not make the phone stutter much and most of the apps and tabs kept open during the test. Only a handful of apps and tabs were required to reload as the system had killed them.
 I did not see any lags while playing either PUBG Mobile or Call of Duty: Mobile in high graphic settings. (Express Photo: Karanveer Singh Arora)MediaTek Helio G80 is a gaming-focused processor, a feature that the Redmi 9 Prime does deliver on. Gaming on the device was very good considering the price. I did not see any lags while playing either PUBG Mobile or Call of Duty: Mobile in high graphic settings. Both of these are processor-intensive games, handling which a lot of phones in this price bracket do stutter or lag.
Cameras
At Rs 9,999, the base variant of the device goes up against devices like the Realme C3, for which the camera hardware is apt. However, the higher variant goes up against devices like the Realme Narzo 10, which has a 48MP quad camera setup. Thus making the Redmi 9 Prime fall a bit short on the spec sheet.
 The wide-angle camera does take good shots, but lacks a bit of the detail. (Express Photo: Karanveer Singh Arora)In good lighting conditions, the Redmi 9 Prime took decent shots with good detail and the right amount of exposure. However, the AI processing did boost the colours up a bit making the images pop out. This is a good thing for people who want to post these images on social media platforms like Instagram. However, if you are looking to get shots with natural colours, this might not be the right choice.

The macro camera manages to take good photos, which look sharp. However, if you have shaky hands the output might come out a bit on the blurry side.
Battery
Redmi 9 Prime with its 5,020mAh battery was able to easily last for more than a day on heavy use. My usage involved playing a few light and heavy games throughout the day, browsing the internet, checking up on social media, keeping track with the news and making a few calls.
 The device feels a bit thick and heavy, due to the 5,020mAh battery. (Express Photo: Karanveer Singh Arora)Having a big battery is a good thing while using the device. But, while charging it with the bundled 10W charger is another thing. The device took around three hours to fully charge. Waiting for so long is not something many would like. However, this problem is solvable as you can get an 18W fast charger to help speed up the process.
What to keep in mind if you buy?
First and foremost, the device feels a bit thick and heavy, due to the 5,020mAh battery. This is not one of the factors that one might be looking for in a smartphone. The performance of the device is quite impressive, however, keep in mind that after a few game rounds, the device does start getting warm. And after around an hour of intensive gaming, it does get a bit uncomfortable to hold.
  The device took around three hours to fully charge. (Express Photo: Karanveer Singh Arora)MIUI 11 is not my piece of cake considering that it feels a bit too cluttered, due to it having no app drawer. It also is too animated for my taste. However, most of my UI design problems have been fixed with MIUI 12, which this phone will be getting in a future update. The UI also features a lot of bloatware like GetApps, Zili, Rummy King, ShareMe and more.
 Night Mode camera sample. (Express Photo: Karanveer Singh Arora)Just like any other budget smartphone, the image output in low light conditions is not that great. The device does manage to take the shots with some detail in them (much more with the Night Mode turned on). However, some grain does manage to creep in and the photos when zoomed in a bit, do tend to pixelate a bit.
Who should buy it and why?
 If you are looking to buy a phone under Rs 10,000, then this is a very good option for you to consider. (Express Photo: Karanveer Singh Arora)If you have a budget of Rs 9,999 and are looking for a good phone that will last you, this is one of the obvious choices. However, at Rs 11,999, the competition stiffens and the device becomes a contender and does not stay the go-to. So if you are looking to buy a phone under Rs 10,000, then this is a very good option for you to consider. However, at Rs 11,999, I feel you should first take a look at devices like the Redmi Note 9 and the Realme Narzo 10, before making your decision.

4568731,0,0,Delhi HC rejects Choksi's plea for pre-screening of 'Bad Boy Billionaires',U.N. chief warns India over 'bad economics' of coal - Reuters Africa,"The Delhi High Court Friday dismissed a plea by Mehul Choksi, an accused in the nearly USD 2 billion PNB scam, to conduct pre-screening of Netflix documentary, Bad Boy Billionaires'.
Justice Navin Chawla, after hearing the matter for over two hours, declined to grant relief to Choksi saying a writ petition for enforcement of a private right cannot be maintainable.
The court said his remedy lies in a civil suit and granted him the liberty to raise the issue in a civil suit.
Choksi, the promoter of Gitanjali Gems, and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank fraud case.
Choksi left the country last year and was granted citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda.
The documentary, Bad Boy Billionaires', which is scheduled to be released in India on September 2, is described on Netflix platform as, This investigative docuseries explores the greed, fraud and corruption that built up - and ultimately brought down - India's most infamous tycoons.
The plea was pre-screening of the documentary was vehemently opposed by Netflix.
(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","NEW DELHI, Aug 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With India facing deadly air pollution, high healthcare costs and growing disaster threats from global warming, the head of the United Nations warned the country’s leaders Friday that investing more in coal was “bad economics”. 
India, the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has been ramping up its use of renewable energy - but coal remains its dominant fuel for power production. 
“India must end its reliance on polluting, financially volatile and costly fossil fuels,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a virtual address to the New Delhi-based environment think-tank The Energy and Resources Institute. 
“Investing in fossil fuels means more deaths and illness and rising healthcare costs. It is, simply put, a human disaster and bad economics.” 
He urged India to instead invest in solar power, which he said could tackle poverty by generating jobs at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has destroyed livelihoods and also boost access to energy for 64 million Indians who live without power. 
“With the COVID-19 pandemic threatening to push many people back into poverty, such job creation is an opportunity that can’t be missed,” he said, adding that investment in renewable energy creates three times more jobs than fossil fuels. 
Guterres called for a halt on commitments to new coal power after 2020, saying “the coal business is going up in smoke” as growing numbers of large investors abandon its use. 
Neither the environment ministry nor the power ministry responded to repeated requests for comment. 
India is the world’s biggest consumer of coal for power after China. 
The coal ministry said on Tuesday that it plans to significantly reduce its coal imports in “the next few years” and boost local production to improve the economies of states in central India, where most coal mines are located. 
The country’s coal demand this year has fallen after strict lockdowns hit the economy. 
‘CHALLENGE IS URGENT’ 
Coal-fired power plants, vehicle exhaust fumes and industry emissions make India home to about half of the world’s 50 most-polluted cities, according to IQAir, a Swiss-based group that gathers air-quality data globally. 
New Delhi was named in February as the capital with the dirtiest air. 
India’s toxic air claimed an estimated 1.24 million lives in 2017, according to a study published by scientific journal The Lancet Planetary Health. 
But Indian cities such as New Delhi got a taste of what lower fossil fuel emissions might look like during the coronavirus lockdown, when a drop in driving and factory output meant blue skies for a time replaced the more usual haze. 
Guterres said 5.5 million deaths could be prevented each year across the world by stopping fossil fuel emissions. 
He lauded India’s growing push for renewable energy, including its recent decision to raise its initial target of 175 gigawatts by 2015 to 500 GW by 2030. 
India has pledged to cut emissions and have clean energy account for at least 40% of its installed power capacity by 2030, up from about 20% now. 
But the country is ahead of schedule, with power generation from non-fossil fuel sources expected to reach 40% by 2022, and over half of total output by 2030, according to the power ministry. 
Guterres, however, said India needed to double down on its coal-cutting efforts to avoid more deadly heatwaves, floods and droughts, increased water stress and reduced food production. 
Facing some of the fastest-rising threats from planetary heating, India was ranked as the fifth most weather-affected country in a climate risk index by environmental think-tank Germanwatch last year. 
Under the Paris climate accord, about 200 countries, including India, in 2015 agreed to slash greenhouse gases and keep global temperature increases “well below” 2 degrees Celsius, with an aim of 1.5C. 
But global emissions continue to rise, and temperatures are ticking upward. 
Guterres warned if the temperature limits were breached, “India will face the brunt of the climate crisis”. 
“Our challenge is urgent and clear,” he said.

2897483,0,0,"US economy sees revival, consumer spending rises a moderate 1.9% in July",Indian rupee soars 43 paise to close at 73.39 against US dollar,"US consumers increased their spending by 1.9 per cent last month, a dose of support for an economy struggling to emerge from the grip of a pandemic that has held back a recovery and kept roughly 27 million people jobless.
The July gain marked the third straight monthly increase in consumer spending, the primary driver of the U.S. economy, but represented a slowdown from the previous two months.
Friday's report from the Commerce Department also showed that income rose 0.4 per cent in July after two months of declines.
The consumer spending report arrives amid a hazy economic landscape, with high unemployment, struggling businesses and deep uncertainty about when the health crisis will be solved and when people and companies will feel confident enough to spend and hire normally again.
It also comes weeks after the expiration of a USD 600-a-week federal unemployment benefit deprived millions of a key source of income and dimmed the outlook for consumer spending.
The economy, after a catastrophic fall in the April-June quarter, is likely expanding again. Home and auto sales have been strong. Stock prices have set record highs.
A persistently high level of confirmed viral cases has damaged several industries, especially those involved with travel, tourism and entertainment, and is holding back growth.
On Thursday, the government reported that roughly 1 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week a historically high level that has prevailed for weeks.
The Conference Board, a business research group, reported this week that consumer confidence has tumbled to its lowest level since 2014.
And in survey results released this week by the National Association for Business Economics, two-thirds of economists who were polled said they thought the economy remains in recession. Nearly half said they didn't expect it to return to pre-pandemic levels until mid-2022.
After enacting a massive financial rescue package in March, congressional Republicans and Democrats have failed to agree on allocating more aid to the unemployed and to struggling states and localities.
The expiration of the USD 600-a-week federal jobless benefit is leaving some families desperate. Economists say the loss of that aid has also deprived the economy of a key pool of spending money.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order Aug. 8 offering a stripped-down version of the expanded unemployment benefit. At least 39 states have accepted or said that they would apply for federal grants that let them increase weekly benefits by USD 300 or USD 400.
But it's unclear how soon that money will actually get to people or how long it will last.
On Thursday, the Federal Reserve announced a major change in how it manages interest rates by saying it plans to keep rates near zero even after inflation has exceeded its 2 per cent target level.
The change means that borrowing rates for households and businesses for everything from auto loans and home mortgages to corporate expansion will likely remain ultra-low for years to come.
Behind the Fed's new thinking is a stubbornly low inflation rate that has long defied the Fed's efforts to raise it and a belief that an exceedingly low jobless rate is critically important for the economy and for individual Americans.

Published: August 28, 2020 7:45:09 pm
It is not known if this increase in the price of televisions in China will also affect the Indian market or not. (Image: Xiaomi)Xiaomi is looking to increase the price of its smart TV range according to a tipster on Weibo, which was first spotted by GizmoChina. According to the tipster, the company is looking to increase the price of its smart TVs by Yuan 100 (approximately Rs 1,1000 to Yuan 300 (approximately Rs 3,300).
The rise in the price of smart TVs will be announced on August 28. He states that the hike is taking place due to the rise in the cost of LCD display panels. The display panels constitute a major part of a TV, considering it is the main component of the product. And if the component cost were to increase it would directly affect the price of the finished product.
It is not known if this increase in the price of televisions in China will also affect the Indian market or not. Xiaomi TVs sold in India are manufactured in India, which means a lot of their parts are also sourced locally. However, there are parts which need to be sourced from the outside like China. These are complex components not manufactured in India. If the cost of these components were to rise, the Indian prices would also rise.
This price increase for LCD panels could have arisen due to high demand and low supply. During the initial days of COVID-19, many factories were shut down completely, due to which supplies were interrupted. Now that the factories are opened up in limited capacities, the output is also limited. However, the demand is steadily rising, considering the arrival of the festival season.

The tipster has further stated that Xiaomi is not the only manufacturer increasing its prices. A number of other manufacturers have already increased the prices for their respective LCD TVs.
According to a separate report by TrendForce 32-inch and 55-inch LCD panels will see a price hike of around 10 per cent by the end of August. Other panel sizes including 50-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch will see an 8 per cent, 5 per cent and 1 per cent rise in the prices, accordingly.

That apart, August Futures and Options (F&amp;O) series, which ended on August 27, saw strong participation from banking sector underlying optimism in the space.
According to global brokerage UBS, the economy is recovering gradually, as suggested by high frequency data, lowering the risks of bad loan formation. ""The recent capital infusion (over US$10bn) in some banks/non-banking financial companies (NBFC) would be additional cushion. We cut our FY21/FY22 estimates for GNPL formation from 7%/5% to 4%/5% of loans. Bank stocks are down 12-62% YTD and have underperformed the broader markets. We think the sector’s downside risks are limited,"" they said in a recent report.
As regards the F&amp;O expiry, IIFL Securities said in an August 28 reprot that Bank Nifty index outperformed the Nifty index by a whopping 5 per cent, reversing the underperformance of the previous series, with both the indices closing 9 per cent/4 per cent higher. Long gamma positions were the flavour of the series as the option writers ran for cover on account of a sharp delta move in the Bank Nifty index.
According to their analysis, IndusInd Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank saw the highest rollovers -- among private peers - at 97 per cent each. ICICI Bank saw rollover of 95 per cent; HDFC Bank (94 per cent); Axis Bank (91 per cent); and Federal Bank (70 per cent).
Meanwhile, Bank of Baroda saw highest rollover in the PSB space at 96 per cent, followed by SBI at 94 per cent; Canara Bank at 83 per cent; and Punjab National Bank at 63 per cent.
""The Bank Nifty saw significant fresh open interest (OI) addition on August 27. While August series saw closure of 0.23 million shares, September series added almost 0.7 million shares in the last sessions. The roll spread in the banking index has remained negative despite continued recovery. We believe it will also witness some pressure during the settlement as short rollover is likely to be seen,"" cautioned analysts at ICICI Securities.
On Friday, Nifty PSU Bank index surged 5 per cent in the intra-day trade today to hit a high of 1,604 level. Nifty Bank, on the othe rhand, rallied 3.5 per cent, hitting a 10-week high of 24,439. Nifty Private Bank index hit a high of 13,428 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), up 3.5 per cent in the intra-day trade. In comparison, the benchmark Nifty50 hit a high of 11,686 on the NSE, up nearly a per cent.
Private Banks surge 
On Friday, Axis Bank jumped 8 per cent on the BSE with a combined 35.69 million shares changing hands on the NSE and BSE till the time of writing of this report. The stock was ruling nearly 7 per cent higher on the benchmark S&amp;P BSE Sensex at 11:41 am and was the top gainer on the index.
UBS, in a report dated August 27, revised the target price on the stock from Rs 600 to Rs 650 with a 'Buy call as it believes the bank has favourable loan mix changes, may gains from its physical and digital networks, and has lower credit cost. Management’s strategy is likely to support its asset quality, in their view.
""We estimate ROE of 8 per cent/12 per cent in FY21/FY22 due to high asset quality risks and a slowing loan book, but we expect ROE to bounce back to about 15% in FY23-FY24. Since its recent share price correction, we consider valuation reasonable. Among the Indian banks we cover, we continue to prefer Axis Bank as we think its retail franchise is strong and valuation inexpensive,"" it said in the report.
That apart, IndusInd Bank surged another 6 per cent today, after rallying nearly 10 per cent on Thursday. UBS has upgraded the stock from 'Sell' to 'Buy' and has increased the target price from Rs 360 to Rs 650. ""Recent regulatory relief could help ease the NPL burden for INDUSIND and mitigate the tail risks of accelerated defaults in the near term. The recent capital infusion of Rs 3300 crore further strengthens the capital buffer. On top of this, we think liquidity risks have reduced as the wholesale funding market is flush with liquidity. Although we expect INDUSIND’s business model to change, resulting in lower return ratios (ROA) than past cycles, we think the current valuation (1.0x FY21E P/BV) appears inexpensive and prices in most negatives,"" the report said.
The brokerage has also raised target price of ICICI Bank from Rs 480 to Rs 520, with a 'Buy' call on the back of its strong retail franchise and moderate asset quality risks. ""Since its recent share price correction, we consider valuations reasonable. We also believe it is well positioned to gain retail market share due to its strong digital footprint. With moderate asset quality risks versus peers, strong retail liability franchise and digital footprint, and strong employee morale in management, we expect ICICI Bank to trade at a premium to its five-year average multiple,"" it said.
Analysts at IDBI Capital also initiated coverage of the stock with a 'Buy' call and target price fixed at Rs 460.
""ICICI Bank is well prepared among its peers to weather the COVID-19 storm with highest PCR (at 75 per cent), highest Covid-19 provisions (1.3 per cent of advances), and higher home loan portfolio (31 per cent of advances). Strong liability franchise and higher Tier I capital ratio will advantage bank when the economy growth recovers. We expect credit growth for the bank to remain higher than the banking industry led by market share gain. We expect loan growth and margin to improve, thus resulting into 50bps YoY improvement in ROA over FY20- FY22E to 1.3 per cent,"" it said in an August 27 report. While the uncertainty over the impact of Covid-19 would weigh on the valuation in the near term but we expect ICICIB to emerge stronger given strength in its business model, they said.
Other private banks such as Federal Bank advanced 9 per cent on the BSE, RBL Bank (5.6 per cent), IDFC First Bank (5.1 per cent), and HDFC Bank (1.1 per cent).
Public Banks outrun private peers
Among PSBs, Canara Bank surged 8.4 per cent, Bank of Baroda (7 per cent), Bank of India (6.6 per cent), SBI (4 per cent), and PNB (4.8 per cent).
""Recent regulatory guidelines on restructuring and current account operations are positive for SBI, in our view. SBI is well capitalised compared with peer SOE banks; SBI had a provisioning coverage ratio (PCR) of 86.3 per cent as of June 2020... The banking business (excluding subsidiaries) is trading at a historically low valuation (0.3x FY21E P/BV), which we believe prices in most negatives. We believe current valuation is inexpensive and could fuel a re-rating,"" said UBS in its recent report. The brokerage has upgraded the stock from 'Sell' to 'Buy' and has assigned a target price of Rs 260 from Rs 160.
Those at JM Financial, on the other hand, believe that the thesis of SBI stock price tracking overall domestic economic trajectory continues to play out. Besides, lower moratorium levels, reasonable capital buffers, sudued risks from YES Bank stake, and cheap valuations make it an attractive pick.
""Despite the 43 per cent rally since lows, we believe the core banking franchise still remains undervalued (at 0.43x /0.42x FY21E/FY22E BVPS, considering a 20% holdco discount for listed subs).

3738756,0,0,Special Report: One Brazilian farmer tried and failed to ranch more responsibly in the Amazon,"NASA Thinks This Planet May Have Water, Where Humans Could Probably Survive","TAILANDIA, Brazil (Reuters) - Mauro Lucio Costa wanted to do the right thing for the world’s largest rainforest. 
For decades, the third-generation rancher in northern Brazil watched guiltily as his industry, feeding soaring global appetite for beef, razed ever more jungle. So, gradually he experimented with grasses and grazing techniques that today make his ranch one of the most efficient in Brazil. Costa became a model for those who believe beef can be raised profitably and sustainably even in the Amazon. 
As a so-called “finishing farm,” Costa’s ranch is the last stop cattle make in a chain that begins with breeders and often includes stays on a progression of other properties before animals are grown and ready for slaughter. 
Eager to do more and push others in the industry toward sustainability, too Costa in 2017 decided to buy cattle only from breeders who could prove they weren’t ranching illegally cleared land. He asked a consultant to check suppliers’ farms for deforestation using satellite maps and a government list of embargoed properties. 
After only a year, though, his effort failed. 
Nearly half his cattle, Costa realized, came from suppliers who either had environmental violations or whose land titles and other paperwork were so questionable that he couldn’t be sure. To see his plan through, he said, he would have been unable to keep his herd populated and produce enough beef to make a profit. 
“I can’t sabotage my business for something no one else does,” Costa told Reuters, surrounded by pastures framed by towering rainforest. A wide-brimmed Resistol hat, a souvenir from trips to Texas, shielded his face from the tropical sun. His embossed belt buckle, also Texan, shone with his name and that of his ranch Marupiara, an indigenous term that loosely means “place of happy hunting.” 
The admission, from a rancher so “green” he addressed attendees of a United Nations climate gathering last year, illustrates the hurdles to responsible development in the Amazon jungle. 
Costa’s effort was entangled by snags that have long hindered order in the vast, unruly region from lax land registries to weak law enforcement to the opaque workings of Brazil’s beef business, in which cattle, with little or no tracking by government or industry, are reared and fattened on a succession of ranches. 
It can be impossible for ranchers like Costa to know for certain where their animals hail from. 
In many other major producers, like the United States, cattle move around less, living longer on single ranches and subsisting more on grains and prepared feeds. But Brazil’s cattle remain mostly grass-fed, using more pasture and leading ranches to specialize in particular stages of the animals’ growth. 
While Brazilian law in theory makes it a crime to raise beef on illegally cleared woodland, few mechanisms exist to help buyers identify cattle’s origins. Livestock, like money, are often laundered, passing from pastures that violate environmental laws, into the legal supply chain, and on to supermarkets and dinner tables worldwide. 
“There is a huge hole in the system,” said Paulo Barreto, one of Brazil’s leading researchers on land use in the Amazon. “No meat processor can say their cattle are deforestation-free.” 
The Amazon, a jungle larger than Western Europe, is a crucial natural bulwark against climate change. It’s a major source of the world’s oxygen and fresh water, its vegetation a giant filter for greenhouse gases. 
Although more than 80% of the original Amazon still stands, deforestation has accelerated in recent years as loggers, soy farmers and cattle ranchers, spurred by ravenous global demand, hack and burn deeper into the rainforest. 
In addition to market forces fueling the devastation, President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right populist, has reversed policies that prevented deforestation, slashing budgets of agencies that for decades fought unauthorized clearing. 
Emboldened by the changes, Brazilians last year felled and burned rainforest equivalent in size to Lebanon, the largest clearing in more than a decade. This year, data suggest deforestation and fires in the Amazon continue apace. 
International outrage is mounting. 
VF Corp, the U.S. company that owns apparel brands including Vans, Timberland, and The North Face, said last year it would stop buying Brazilian leather. In May, British supermarkets threatened to boycott Brazilian products. In June, a group of major European investors said it was considering divesting its Brazilian holdings, including government bonds, if Bolsonaro doesn’t change course. 
He has paid little heed. 
Ricardo Salles, Bolsonaro’s environment minister, in April suggested that Brazil take advantage of the world’s distraction with coronavirus to accelerate deregulation of forestry laws. “We need to make an effort,” he said in a video of a cabinet meeting, “to push everything through, change it all, simplify norms.” 
Last year, after a climate conference in Madrid, he tweeted a photo of a large, rare steak, joking that he was offsetting the meeting’s carbon emissions with “a veggie lunch.” When challenged by lawmakers, environmental activists, and Brazilian media about his comments at the cabinet meeting, Salles in a statement said he had always supported deregulation “with good sense” and “within the law.” 
The ministry declined a Reuters request for further comment. 
Once confined largely to the rolling pastures of Brazil’s temperate south, ranchers have used genetic advances to breed cattle that better weather equatorial heat. 
In recent decades, ranchers pushed into the tropics, breeding the world’s largest beef herd, now with some 215 million animals. They also became the top exporters of beef, controlling about 20% of the global export market and selling almost 2 million tons of the meat annually to countries as far afield as China, Russia and Egypt. 
A handful of Brazilian multinationals, including JBS SA, Minerva SA, and Marfrig Global Foods SA, ship most of those exports. But those meatpackers, from whom major retailers buy their beef, get the meat from a large and disparate array of suppliers, from small family farms to more sophisticated ranchers like Costa. 
The Brazilian industry is recognized globally for strict sanitary policies and high-quality meat, but it has struggled to comply with its own nation’s forestry laws. 
In 2009, Brazilian prosecutors threatened to identify and prosecute companies buying beef from illegal pastures. The big meatpackers, in response, started using satellite imagery and data to better track suppliers. 
Deforestation slowed. 
But the data only showed the land farmed by the immediate seller not pastures where cattle grazed previously. Because there is no unified system to trace cattle transfers between ranches, going further has proven impossible. 
JBS, Minerva and Marfrig, publicly traded companies with operations in dozens of countries, all told Reuters they recognize the problem with so-called “indirect suppliers” and that the industry and regulators must work together to solve it. 
Just before Bolsonaro was elected in 2018, Brazil’s government drafted a voluntary agreement with major meatpackers and retailers to develop a tighter monitoring mechanism. The plan, previously unreported and recently reviewed by Reuters, would have used an existing system of livestock transport permits to track cattle movement. 
“The Environment Ministry commits to developing a computerized system to verify the origin of cattle and the preservation of native vegetation,” the draft said. 
But the Environment Ministry shelved the project after Bolsonaro won, according to three people familiar with the decision. “It could have really made a difference,” said Juliana Simoes, one of the people and a former ministry official who led the effort. 
The ministry declined to answer questions from Reuters about the aborted agreement, saying only that it “supports the concept of traceability in agriculture.” 
“LAND WITHOUT MEN” 
For most of its history, the Amazon was considered a “green hell,” dense and inhospitable for almost anyone besides the indigenous peoples already living there. Save for isolated settlements along the region’s many rivers, colonists and Brazil’s early governments pursued little development. 
In the 1970s, Brazil’s military dictatorship decided to build roads and promote migration, through cheap loans for land, to the Amazon. “Land without men,” the government slogan went, “for men without land.” 
Costa, now 55 years old, first came when his father, a rancher like Costa’s grandfather, took a government loan for a parcel in the Amazonian state of Para. At first, the family continued living in southern Brazil, traveling occasionally to Para, where a young Costa watched his father clear jungle with hired hands and chainsaws. 
At 17, Costa moved to Para for good, working for a while on his father’s ranch and later taking jobs at other ranches and a nearby slaughterhouse. Paragominas, the sawmill town nearby, was so violent it came to be known as “Paragobala” “Paragobullet.” The farm had no electricity, the roads and surrounding woodland dangerous. 
“I cried nearly every day,” he recalls. 
Soon enough, he met a fellow rancher’s daughter. They fell in love, married and started a family. 
Millions more Brazilians migrated to the Amazon. Wildcatters and squatters seized land without titles, forging deeds and other permits that still make the region a bramble of land conflicts and legal uncertainty. By the late 1980s, Amazon deforestation had become a signature issue of the modern-day environmentalist movement. 
All around, Costa saw waste. 
After loggers fell valuable timber, ranchers follow, plant grass and put cattle to pasture. Without the native flora, the once-rich soil dries quickly and loses nutrients. So ranchers move on. 
“People just cut down more trees,” Costa said, driving past abandoned pastures near Paragominas. Deeper into the forest, he pulled near a large truck, with no license plate, stacked high with freshly cut hardwood. “All illegal,” he said. 
At present, about 70% of the deforested land in the Amazon is used for cattle, according to estimates by Daniel Nepstad, a veteran ecologist of the region. The nine states that form the Brazilian Amazon account for 40% of the country’s herd. Para, a state larger than Texas and California combined, by itself accounts for about 10% of Brazil’s cattle. 
Costa’s zeal for conservation came not from a love of nature, but of numbers. He keeps a large Casio calculator in his ranch office and punctuates his conversation with clicks on its keys. 
In 1997, he struck out on his own, determined to find methods to avoid the wastefulness of slash-and-burn ranching. For about $190,000, he and a partner bought the land he currently ranches, near the Para town of Tailandia. A previous owner had cleared about 7% of the total plot of about 4,300 hectares, but it lay idle. 
Costa planted new grasses. He fertilized the pastures and rotated cattle on a grazing schedule to optimize feeding times and grass growth. “Even a few hours can make a difference,” he said. 
He currently farms about 500 hectares, roughly the size of 700 professional soccer fields. Because of a perverse irony of Amazon real estate, Costa actually leaves money on the table by not clearing the remaining 80% of his land. 
Despite the ecological wealth that woodland represents, cleared land sells for multiples what virgin rainforest does because farmers find it more useful. The dynamic discourages conservation, incentivizing destruction even if fields aren’t ranched. 
“Even my father-in-law thought I should cut more trees,” Costa said. “Forest doesn’t create value.” 
When leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva became president in 2003, he sought to tackle deforestation. His government created nature reserves, better tracked logging and forest fires, and eventually blocked financing for farmers and ranchers caught working illegally cleared land. By the time Lula finished his second term, the annual rate of deforestation had plummeted almost 75%. 
Costa, meanwhile, further improved his grazing practices. He took soil samples, analyzed land chemistry and increased the number of cattle that could graze each hectare he ranches. He also received threats, he said, from people scorning his decision to leave so much forest intact. 
“I suffered a lot of bullying,” he said. “If you don’t use it, someone else will,” anonymous callers warned, a threat not easily dismissed in a region rife with squatters and murderous land disputes. 
Still, his methods paid off. 
Costa now ranches nearly four times as many head per hectare than the average in Brazil, according to government statistics. By that metric, if other ranchers in the Amazon became as efficient, an area the size of France could be reforested on land today grazed by cattle. 
Seeking the secrets of his success, such as the seven different grasses he now grows, fellow ranchers visit Costa often, eager for a peek in the neat black ledger he carries. “He’s the best there is,” said Jordan Timo, a fellow rancher and the consultant Costa asked to help him track suppliers. 
“PREACHING IN THE DESERT” 
Brazil’s gains against deforestation early this century were shortlived. 
A global commodities boom a decade ago fueled greater demand for beef and soy. Former President Dilma Rousseff, Lula’s successor, sought to leverage the commodities bonanza to revive big infrastructure projects in the region. She relaxed regulations on nature reserves and pursued major hydroelectric projects on Amazon tributaries. 
By 2015, the boom fizzled, draining government revenues. Rousseff and her successor, Michel Temer, cut financing and stripped powers from Ibama, Brazil’s environmental agency. State and municipal authorities, squeezed by budget shortfalls of their own, struggled to fund law enforcement vital for monitoring destruction locally. 
Deforestation rebounded. 
After early success tracking supply, the 2009 agreement with meatpackers to better monitor ranches yielded less progress than hoped for. JBS, Minerva and Marfrig say they continue to monitor the land of their immediate suppliers. But they remain unable to track where those vendors get the animals. Smaller meatpackers, meanwhile, never signed the agreement. 
Prosecutors in charge of environmental enforcement say any further crackdown, tracing beef throughout the industry, would in essence halt Brazil’s cattle business. “You would destroy the meatpacking industry,” said Ricardo Negrini, a federal prosecutor in Belem, Para’s capital. “It has to be done gradually.” 
Holly Gibbs, a geographer at the University of Wisconsin who has investigated land use by Brazil’s beef industry, said only about 3% of cattle in Para and nearby states spend life on just one farm. 
Ranchers have all manner of tricks to get around controls, like splitting their tracts into separate titles, enabling them to graze cattle on illegally cleared pastures but then sell those animals from seemingly legitimate land. 
The industry is so opaque that even ranchers sanctioned for deforestation sell their cattle easily. Moises Berta, who ranches near the frontier town of Novo Progresso, was fined by Ibama in 2016 for illegally cleared land. He admits he cleared the tract, but said he had no other choice to make a living. 
The fine means his farm shows up on lists used by major meatpackers to block vendors. Berta said he has no trouble, however, getting his beef to market via middlemen or smaller slaughterhouses. On the downside, he said, these buyers pay about 20% less than the majors. “It’s a difficult situation,” the 61-year-old told Reuters. 
There are over 37,000 parcels in Amazon states that have been sanctioned by Ibama for environmental crimes. Fines are meant to blacklist areas for commercial use until owners replant cleared forest. In practice they do little more than force ranchers like Berta underground. 
For the methodical Costa, the preponderance of illegal ranching thwarted his effort to ensure a clean supply. 
About a third of his cattle, he calculated, came from land that has been sanctioned. Another 15% came from ranches with deeds and other paperwork that don’t jibe with public registries, making it impossible for Costa to check their land against embargo lists. 
The math in his black ledger spoke clearly. 
To recoup his investments in priming his pastures, Costa needs to boost his herd count from about 1,700 to 2,500 cattle each year just as the rainy season begins, usually in mid-December. The timing matters because that’s when cattle can take advantage of the sudden acceleration in grass growth brought by the rain. 
If the herd is too small, some of the grass goes to waste. If he misses the window, Costa must spend yet more to buy feed. If Costa blocked cattle suppliers he knew or suspected had illegally cleared land, he realized, his herd wouldn’t reach the critical mass necessary for “as aguas,” as the rains are called.

Instead of his usual profit of roughly $85 per animal, Costa would have suffered a loss of about $50 per head. “It just wasn’t going to work,” he explained. 
He abandoned the effort. 
As a result, Costa himself plays an indirect role in perpetuating at least some of the illegality. He feels tethered, he said, with few options to change a system that keeps him from ranching the way he believes he should. “I feel like I’m preaching in the desert.”","Even though we love our planet so dearly, we often think that human civilization could step out of this planet and venture out into space to make another planet our home.

The celestial object is only slightly larger than our Earth and is known to orbit the dwarf star Proxima Centauri -- the closest star to our solar system. This planet is in the Goldilocks zone -- a zone where the temperature is neither too hot nor too cold, just right for human civilization. 
NASA says while sharing the artist's view of the planets surface, Discovered in 2016, a roughly Earth-sized planet orbiting our nearest neighbouring star might be habitable, according to astronomers using the European Southern Observatory's 3.6-meter telescope at La Silla, Chile, along with other telescopes around the world. The exoplanet is at a distance from its star that allows temperatures mild enough for liquid water to pool on its surface.
NASA added, This artists impression shows a view of the surface of the planet Proxima b orbiting the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the solar system. The double star Alpha Centauri AB also appears in the image. Proxima b is a little more massive than the Earth and orbits in the habitable zone around Proxima Centauri, where the temperature is suitable for liquid water to exist on its surface.

Could this planet possess any life? Who knows! It will be several years till a probe could reach the planet and help us know it better as the planet is roughly 4.2 light-years away. 
Just to put this into perspective, even with the probe moving at the speed of light would take 4 years to reach there. We dont have such fast spacecraft yet, so well have to wait till the technology advances.",https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN25O1QX,https://www.indiatimes.com/technology/science-and-future/nasa-proxima-b-planet-water-human-colony-521465.html
4682809,0,0,Japanese PM Shinzo Abe steps down  cites chronic illness as reason,"UPDATE 1-China's BoCom bank Jan-June profit drops 14.6%, first H1 profit fall since listing – Reuters","Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan’s longest-serving premier, announced his resignation because of poor health on Friday, ending a stint at the helm of the world’s third-biggest economy in which he sought to revive growth and bolster its defences.
“I have decided that I will step down as prime minister, with the belief that I cannot continue being prime minister if I do not have the confidence that I can carry out the job entrusted to me by the people,” Abe, 65, told a news conference.
He said he had decided to step down now to avoid a political vacuum as the country copes with its novel coronavirus outbreak.
“I apologize from the bottom of my heart that despite all of the support from the Japanese people, I am leaving the post with one full year left in my term and in the midst of various policies and coronavirus,” Abe said. He similarly quit in 2007 after one year as premier, citing illness.
It was the second time Abe has resigned as prime minister because of poor health.
He has battled the disease ulcerative colitis for years and two recent hospital visits within a week had fanned questions on whether he could stay in the job until the end of his term as ruling party leader, and hence, premier, in September 2021.
As news of the resignation spread, Japan's benchmark Nikkei average .N225 fell 2.12% to 22,717.02, while the broader Topix .TOPX shed 1.00% to 1,599.70. The selling wiped $47 billion off Tokyo's $5.7 trillion stock market value, which had more than doubled during Abe's tenure.
The resignation will trigger a leadership race in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) - most likely in two or three weeks - and the winner must be formally elected in parliament. The new party leader will hold the post for the rest of Abe’s term.
Former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba and former foreign minister Fumio Kishida both quickly expressed interest in the top job, media reported. Among others whose names have been floated is Abe’s close aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.
Whoever wins the party poll is likely to keep Abe’s reflationary “Abenomics” policies as Japan struggles with the impact of the novel coronavirus, but may have trouble emulating the political longevity that may be Abe’s biggest legacy.
“The broad picture remains in tact. In terms of economic and fiscal policy, the focus remains very much on reflation,” said Jesper Koll, senior adviser to asset manager WisdomTree Investments.
“Longevity will be a struggle.”
On Monday, Abe surpassed a record for longest consecutive tenure as premier set by his great-uncle Eisaku Sato half a century ago.
“As head of the ruling party he worked hard on Abenomics for eight years,” said Naohito Kojima, 55, a brokerage employee.
“There were various problems but if someone else had been leader, it’s questionable whether they could have maintained a stable government as long as Mr Abe. He did various diplomatic negotiations and I think the pros outweighed the cons.”
Abe’s resignation also comes amid an uncertain geopolitical environment, including an intensifying confrontation between the United States and China and ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.
Falling Support
The conservative Abe returned as prime minister for a rare second term in December 2012, pledging to revive growth with his “Abenomics” mix of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and reforms. He also pledged to beef up Japan’s defences and aimed to revise the pacifist constitution.
Under fire for his handling of the coronavirus and scandals among party members, Abe has recently seen his support fall to one of the lowest levels of his nearly eight years in office.
Japan has not suffered the explosive surge in virus cases seen elsewhere but Abe had drawn fire for a clumsy early response and what critics see as a lack of leadership as infections spread.
In the second quarter, Japan was hit by its biggest economic slump on record as the pandemic emptied shopping malls and crushed demand for cars and other exports, bolstering the case for bolder policy action to avert a deeper recession.
Abe kept his promises to strengthen defences, boosting spending on the military after years of declines and expanding its capacity to project power abroad.
In a historic shift in 2014, his government re-interpreted the constitution to allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two.
A year later, Japan adopted laws scrapping a ban on exercising the right of collective self-defence or defending a friendly country under attack.
But Abe proved unable to revise the U.S.-drafted, post-war constitution’s pacifist Article 9, a personal mission that also eluded his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who quit as premier in 1960 because of uproar over a U.S-Japan security pact.
Abe resigned from his first stint as prime minister in 2007, citing ill-health after a year plagued by scandals in his cabinet and a huge election loss for his ruling party. He had since kept his illness in check with medicine that was not previously available.","* BoCom’s H1 profit 36.5 bln yuan vs 42.75 bln yuan year-ago 
* Bad loans rise 
* NIM 1.53 pct end-June vs 1.55 pct end March (Adds details) 
BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Bank of Communications Co Ltd, China’s sixth-largest bank by assets, reported on Friday a 14.6% decline in first-half profit as sour debt rose amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
It was the first time the bank has reported a profit fall in the January-June period since it publicly listed its shares in Shanghai in 2007. 
The results highlight the impact of the pandemic and the slowing economy on Chinese banks after they bucked the global trend in the first quarter by posting higher quarterly profits and steady bad loans. 
BoCom is the first of China’s largest state-owned banks to report half-year earnings. 
Profit came in at 36.5 billion yuan ($5.32 billion) for January-June, compared to 42.75 billion yuan a year earlier, the bank said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. 
That implied a second-quarter net profit of 15.1 billion yuan, down 30.6% versus a year earlier, Reuters calculations show. 
China’s top banking watchdog has asked state lenders to fully recognise bad loans on balance sheets and increase their buffers for covering souring debt in the first half, weighing on their profits, people familiar with the matter have said. 
During the reporting period, BoCom disposed of non-performing loans totalling 34.3 billion, an increase of 25% on a year-on-year basis. 
The state-owned lender’s non-performing loan ratio rose to 1.68% at end-June from 1.59% at end-March. 
Meanwhile, its net interest margin, a key gauge of profitability, fell to 1.53% by end-June from 1.55% at end-March. 
Chinese commercial banks overall posted a 9.4% drop in first half net profit to 1 trillion yuan, according to data from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC). 
By the end of the June quarter, the average non-performing loan ratio for commercial banks was at 1.94%, CBIRC data showed, the highest since the global financial crisis.

190635,0,0,Leonard Cohen's estate slams Republicans' use of 'Hallelujah' as bid to politicize - Reuters,Rajnath Singh expected to visit Russia next week to attend SCO meet,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The estate of Leonard Cohen said on Friday it was considering legal action over the use of the Canadian singer’s “Hallelujah” at the Republican National Convention (RNC), calling it a brazen attempt to politicize the song. 
A recording of “Hallelujah” by Tori Kelly was played during a fireworks display on Thursday night that followed President Donald Trump’s acceptance speech for the Republican nomination. 
A second, more operatic version, was performed on camera by American tenor Christopher Macchio. 
Cohen’s estate said in a statement that it was “surprised and dismayed” the song had been used, saying it had specifically denied the RNC’s request to do so. 
It said it was exploring legal options and called the RNC’s decision a “rather brazen attempt to politicize and exploit in such an egregious manner ‘Hallelujah’, one of the most important songs in the Cohen song catalogue.”  
“Had the RNC requested another song, ‘You Want it Darker’, for which Leonard won a posthumous Grammy in 2017, we might have considered approval of that song,” the statement added. 
Cohen died in 2016 at age 82 after a late career revival. “Hallelujah,” first released in 1984, has become his most-performed song. 
The use of the song dismayed Cohen fans on social media and followed a pattern of unauthorized pop songs at Trump events and rallies. 
The Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Tom Petty, Rihanna, Elton John, Adele, and Queen are among dozens of musicians who have issued cease and desist letters or spoken out against their music being used at Trump rallies. 
Reporting by Jill Serjeant","Defence Minister Rajnath Singh is expected to visit Russia next week to attend a crucial meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) which is expected to deliberate on regional security scenario and geo-strategic developments, official sources said on Friday.
The SCO defence ministers' meeting is taking place at a time when two of its member countries, India and China, are locked in a bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh.
The sources said Singh is likely to leave for Moscow on September 3 as the meeting is expected to take place the next day.
It will be Singh's second visit to Moscow since June. He had represented India at the Victory Day Parade in Moscow on June 24 that commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War.
Russia has also invited External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to attend the SCO foreign ministers' meeting on September 10.
When asked whether Jaishankar will travel to Moscow for the meeting, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Thursday said the minister has received the invitation and a decision on his participation would be made known once it is taken.

In a related development, India will send a tri-services contingent to Russia to take part in a multilateral war game next month which will also be joined by China, Pakistan and a number of other SCO member nations.
Around 150 Indian Army troops, 45 Indian Air Force personnel and a number of Navy officers will form the Indian contingent for the exercise scheduled to be held in the Astrakhan region in southern Russia from September 15 to 26.
Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in a standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh for over three-and-a-half months. Both the countries are holding talks at military and diplomatic levels to resolve the dispute.
Russia has already said that India and China should resolve the border dispute through talks and that a ""constructive"" relationship between the two countries was important for regional stability.
The SCO, seen as a counterweight to NATO, has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations which accounts for almost 44 per cent of the world population stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea.

6060172,0,0,China to unveil bronze statue of Dr Dwarkanath Kotnis for his contributions,TikTok booms in Southeast Asia as it picks path through political minefields,"A bronze statue of Indian doctor Dwarkanath Kotnis, who is revered in China for his contributions during the Chinese revolution headed by its founder Mao Zedong and the World War II, would be unveiled outside a medical school in North China next month, according to the official media here.
Kotnis, who hailed from Sholapur in Maharashtra came to China in 1938 as part of a five-member team of doctors sent by the Indian National Congress to help the Chinese during World War II. He joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1942 and died the same year at the age of 32.
The bronze statue of Kotnis, known in China as Ke Dihua, would be formally unveiled at the medical school at Shijiazhuang in September, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday.
Kotnis' medical assistance during the difficult days of the Chinese revolution was praised by Chinese leader Mao Zedong. His status and memorials were also set in some of the Chinese cities in recognition of his services.
He is married to Chinese national Guo Qinglan, who died in 2012.
Apart from the school named after him as the Shijiazhuang Ke Dihua Medical Science Secondary Specialised School, there are memorials of Kotnis in both Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, and Tangxian county where he once worked.
Late Chinese leader Mao Zedong was deeply affected by his death, the report said.
Mao wrote in his eulogy that ""the army has lost a helping hand, the nation has lost a friend. Let us always bear in mind his internationalist spirit"".
According to Liu Wenzhu, an official of the Shijiazhuang Ke Dihua Medical Science Secondary Specialised School, since the founding of the school in 1992 more than 45,000 medical professionals have graduated from it.
Each of the new students and staff must swear in front of a stone statue of Kotnis that they would work like him, he said.
Liu hopes that Kotnis will be remembered not only as a symbol inspiring medical students to work hard, but also an eternal bond between the people of China and India.
""We are the world's two most populous countries ... We should always be friends, coexisting peacefully,"" he told Xinhua.
(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - At 19, Sandy Saputra is big on TikTok Indonesia. Within a year, he’s leapt from quiet, small-town life to star influencer status as more than 10.5 million followers lap up his toothy grin in dancing, pranking and lip-synching videos on the booming app. 
Sandy’s success, becoming his family’s main breadwinner as global brands like Coca Cola or Suntory pay to have their names on his light-hearted clips, comes as TikTok mushrooms across Southeast Asia. Data trackers show it’s been downloaded hundreds of millions of times already in a region with a collective population of 630 million - half of them under 30. 
But it also comes as concerns over how secure user data is in the hands of its Chinese owner ByteDance summon big storm clouds elsewhere - TikTok has been banned in India and President Donald Trump has ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations, triggering the resignation on Thursday of only recently installed CEO Kevin Mayer. 
Southeast Asia offers a clear view of the global strategy ByteDance is implementing to avoid crackdowns in other regions that influencers like Saputra now fear. The approach is to launch ‘non-political’ products fast, promising to governments in places like Vietnam that content will be tightly policed in accordance with local laws, according to interviews with a dozen current and former employees. 
The region is now key to the future of TikTok and ByteDance: The Chinese firm is already plugging TikTok as part of a suite of interconnected apps for live video streaming, messaging and music, tackling U.S. behemoths Facebook and Google head on as both pour billions into Southeast Asia. 
ByteDance declined to comment for this article, and it’s unclear whether or how the prospective sale of operations in the United States and elsewhere might effect Southeast Asia. But in his base in Sukabumi, West Java province, Saputra is only too aware of risks. 
""Of course I do think about it ... It would be so disappointing if TikTok was erased from Indonesia,"" Saputra told Reuters, speaking before filming a sketch www.tiktok.com/@sandys.ss in a paddy field. 
“It wasn’t planned out. I was an ordinary person, making videos like any other normal person, who didn’t have an idea on how this would play out,” said Saputra, now adding hundreds of thousands of TikTok followers every week. 
SISTER APPS 
In the meantime, TikTok is ploughing ahead testing ‘creator’ marketplaces across the region, championing influencers like Saputra, and negotiating data deals with telecoms firms to keep a lid on consumers’ smartphone bills, according to interviews with current and former staffers. 
It’s chasing small to medium-sized businesses as advertisers - nearly nine out of every 10 firms in Southeast Asia are classified as small - complete with how-to-advertise seminars, millions of dollars in advertising credits, and a self-service platform for businesses to make their own ads. 
TikTok is piloting live-streaming commercial initiatives pioneered in China, Southeast Asia business marketing head Chew Wee Ng said in an interview with Reuters. Meanwhile ByteDance is heavily promoting sister apps like Singapore-headquartered business messaging service Lark and music streaming service Resso. 
“TikTok is really unique in that people expect to see advertisers and they want to co-create with brands,” said Ng, a former Google executive based in Singapore. 
According to data from app analytics firm Sensor Tower, TikTok has had more than 360 millions downloads in Southeast Asia, nearly half of them in Indonesia, with 151% growth year-on-year for 2020. 
An internal ByteDance 2019 presentation reviewed by Reuters showed that last year TikTok had 43.5 million monthly active users in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, with the majority female, the biggest online consumers in the region. 
The app grew staggeringly fast in recent months, sources said, as lockdowns enforced across the region to tackle the coronavirus pandemic forced people to stay home. In Indonesia, Saputra said he’s been acquiring 100,000 followers every three days. 
LOCAL MODERATORS 
With growth has come increased government scrutiny, but ByteDance has already had plenty of experience dealing with that. As on other business matters, ByteDance declined to comment on its handling of scrutiny. 
Indonesia presented one of its first major global policy challenges in 2018, after authorities briefly banned TikTok for posts they said contained “pornography, inappropriate content and blasphemy”. 
Within 24 hours, the firm had dispatched senior executives to negotiate with Indonesia, promising to raise the age of its users and to hire a team of local moderators, according to sources and to the-then Indonesian communications minister. 
It would quickly copy this approach by installing moderators across its Southeast Asian markets in a bid to insure compliance with local laws. 
Reuters reported in August that from 2018 until 2020, ByteDance censored content that it perceived as critical of the Chinese government on a news aggregator app in Indonesia known as BaBe at the behest of ByteDance’s China headquarters. 
As of August 2020, most of the content guidelines have been localised for individual Southeast Asian countries. That has often meant strict censorship of local political content. 
In Thailand, where a youth protest movement is challenging the country’s monarchy, some users told Reuters their pro-protest videos had been taken down. [L4N2FK2IX] 
‘IN VIETNAM, CHINA IS POLITICAL’ 
In Vietnam, TikTok has blocked most political content for years, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company declined to comment. 
Hanoi has been in a long-running conflict with U.S. tech giants over demands to restrict any content deemed against the state and create local offices in Vietnam. 
Reuters reported in April that Facebook agreed to increase censorship of “anti-state” posts in Vietnam after its local servers were temporarily taken off-line. [L3N2CA1L0] 
ByteDance, which unlike big U.S. tech players does have an office in the country, decided to pre-empt issues with the government by promising to make its app ‘non-political’. 
Due to Vietnam’s contentious relationship with China, ByteDance decided it would also ban content critical of Beijing, and anything related to tensions between the two governments. 
“In Vietnam, China is political,” one source said. 
The approach has been effective. TikTok now counts Vietnam, a multi-billion dollar market for social media firms, as among its most profitable in Asia, according to sources with knowledge of the matter, while launching regular campaigns with authorities on safety and tourism. 
Back in West Java, Sandy Saputra aims to keep on flashing grins and goofing around on TikTok. 
“To me, this isn’t a job,” he said, before breaking away into another dance routine. “It’s a hobby that makes money.”

With a total of 60,177 patients having recuperated in a span of 24 hours, the recoveries have surged to 25,83,948 and the recovery rate has reached 76.28 per cent. 
""Higher number of recoveries has led to a constantly growing difference between recoveries and active cases. Crossing 18 lakhs, the difference stands at 18,41,925 today,"" the ministry said. 
The Union government has adopted a graded and evolving strategic response to COVID management in India within the larger evolving global context. 
The early focus on surveillance and contact-tracing through house-to-house survey was continuously strengthened with increase in testing for ensuring early identification of positive cases. 
This has ensured prompt isolation of the confirmed positive cases either in supervised home care for the mild and moderate ones or in hospitals in case of those exhibiting critical symptoms, the ministry said. 
The Centre has led the country-wide response and management with steady ramping up of hospital infrastructure through the three-tiered dedicated COVID facilities - Dedicated COVID Hospitals (DCHs) with ICU bed, ventilators etc.,for critical care management; Dedicated COVID Health Centres (DCHCs) with oxygen beds and doctor on call facility and COVID Care Centres (CCCs) with isolation beds.

3131431,0,0,China warns Norway against granting Nobel Peace Prize to Hong Kong democracy activists,"German yields rise to highest since June, focus turns to euro zone inflation - Reuters","Beijing: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, on a rare visit to Norway, warned Oslo against granting the Nobel Peace Prize to Hong Kong pro-democracy activists much on the lines of awarding the prize to China's human rights activist Liu Xiaobo and Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in the past, causing strains in bilateral ties. 
Wang, who is currently on a tour of European Union countries to shore-up support for China in the face of the increasing pressure mounted by the US, is the first Chinese foreign minister to visit Oslo in 15 years. 
Relations between China and the US are at an all-time low over the coronavirus pandemic and strained trade ties. The two countries also recently closed each other's consulates in Houston and Chengdu. 
Wang's visit comes in the backdrop of Norway preparing to take up a rotational seat on the United Nations Security Council, of which China is a permanent member. 
Wang also held talks with Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide on Thursday. 
Later, when asked during media interaction on how China would react if the Nobel prize would go to Hong Kong protesters in future, Wang said ""I would only say one thing: In the past, today, and in future, China will firmly reject any attempt by anyone to use the Nobel Peace Prize to interfere in China's internal affairs"". 
""China is rock firm on this principle. We don't want to see anyone politicise the Nobel Peace Prize,"" the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post quoted him as saying. 
He called on Norway to cherish the current relationship, saying ""If we can continue to respect each other and treat each other as equals ... our bilateral relationship can continue to develop in a sustained and sound manner, and the political foundation of the bilateral relationship can be further consolidated."" 
Both officials stressed that this was the first visit to Norway by a Chinese foreign minister in 15 years - a subtle reference to the previously frozen diplomatic relationship between 2010 and 2016, after the Oslo-based Nobel Peace Prize committee awarded the prize to Chinese dissident Liu, the Post report said. 
China was also cut up with the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama in 1989. 
Till 2012, the Nobel Prize was viewed with contempt by China and its official media as it was awarded to the Dalai Lama for his peaceful struggle for the betterment of Tibetans and to Liu. 
However, Beijing welcomed the Nobel Prize for literature to Chinese writer Mo Yan in 2012, saying that Mo's ""victory reflects the prosperity and progress of Chinese literature, as well as the increasing influence of China"". 
Wang's strong opposition to the Nobel Prize to the Hong Kong pro-democracy activists followed most of the EU countries cancelling extradition treaties with Hong Kong besides opening up their countries for Hong Kongers after China took direct control of the former British colony by passing a national security law which empowers Beijing to take direct control of the security and law and order, undermining the 'one country two systems' principle. 
Soreide said that Norway values China's interests and concerns and is willing to discuss relevant issues with China in the spirit of mutual respect. 
Norway has always supported multilateralism and advocated promoting global free trade and maintaining international order. Amid rising global instability, Norway is willing to join hands with the international community, including China, to carry out more international cooperation, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. 
The two also had an in-depth exchange of views on international and regional issues of common concern. 
Norway is the third leg of Wang's ongoing European tour, in which he visited Italy and the Netherlands. He will also visit France and Germany during the tour.","* Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr
By Yoruk Bahceli 
AMSTERDAM, Aug 28 (Reuters) - German bond yields rose to their highest since early June in early Friday trade, after the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to target average inflation pushed yields to multi-month highs on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Thursday the central bank would now try to keep inflation at an average 2% over time, offsetting below-2% periods with higher inflation “for some time”, and to ensure employment does not fall short of its maximum level. 
Attention now turns to inflation readings in the euro zone after the Fed’s decision. 
French inflation on Friday came in line with expectations from a Reuters poll, rising 0.2% in August, down from 0.9% in July. German and euro zone inflation readings will follow next week. 
Readings are expected to show euro zone inflation at just 0.2% August, far below the European Central Bank’s target of close to but below 2%, leading some analysts to see the rise in market inflation expectations as unsustainable. Long-term expectations are now near their highest since early February, before the coronavirus shook European markets, at over 1.25%. 
“Today’s first indications for euro inflation during August from France should underscore the central banks’ challenges in reaching their inflation targets,” Commerzbank’s head of rates and credit research, Christoph Rieger, told clients. 
“With this, euro break-evens at pre-crisis levels hold downside potential and we still see better value in buying Bund dips above -0.4% 10-year yields,” he said, referring to the measure of inflation expectations. 
Germany’s 10-year yield rose to their highest since early June at -0.372% in early trade. They were last up 2 basis points at -0.38%. 
Italy’s 10-year bond yield rose 2 basis points to its highest in nearly four weeks at 1.115% ahead of an auction. 
Italy is scheduled to sell 8.25 billion euros through a new five-year bond and re-open three- and 10-year bonds.

2416440,0,0,"Kerala gold smuggling case: Day after questioning, Janam TV journalist says ‘staying away from responsibilities’",TikTok booms in Southeast Asia as it picks path through political minefields,"Nambiar is a coordinating news editor with Janam TV. (Facebook/Anil Nambiar)A day after being questioned by the Customs Department in connection with the Kerala gold smuggling case, senior journalist Anil Nambiar on Friday said that he was “staying away from the responsibilities” assigned by Janam TV until the shadow of doubts around him was cleared.
Nambiar, the coordinating news editor with Janam TV, also stated that the move by the Kerala government was “aimed at striking the higher-ups in the BJP”.
“Janam TV is presenting all the reports related to this perfectly and objectively. It should continue to go strongly. I understand that my presence with the channel is an obstacle to the flow of news. Until the doubts around me on this topic are resolved, I will stay away from the responsibilities assigned by Janam TV,” Nambiar said in a Facebook post.
On Thursday, Nambiar was questioned in connection with the probe into the smuggling of gold through diplomatic cargo to the UAE Consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. He was in touch with accused Swapna Suresh on July 5, the day Customs recovered the smuggled gold.

Nambiar, who is the face of Janam TV, a news and entertainment channel, has been anchoring several debates about the smuggling case since it came to light.
We are looking to see whether the accused got any support from the journalist. There had been telephone calls between the two after the gold was seized. It is too early to say anything about his role in the case. We are looking at whether he had any knowledge about the smuggling and whether he had given any input to Suresh to get out of the incident after gold was seized, sources in the Customs Department said on Thursday after his questioning.

Janam TV chief editor G K Suresh Babu said Nambiar had figured in the call list of Suresh. When we heard about it, an explanation was sought from him. Nambiar told us that he called Suresh to get a reaction from the Consulate after hearing about the gold seizure. Later, she called back and told him the Consulate had no role in it. Nambiar told us that he had no other links with Suresh over the last one year. He said she helped him get a visa to interview jewellery owner Atlas Ramachandran (who had been jailed in UAE in a cheque bounce case), Babu added.

He had said that if anything was found amiss in Nambiars dealings on this issue, action would be taken against him. Janam TV is a channel with a nationalistic view. We cannot compromise on national interest, he added.
Nambiar was earlier involved in a forgery case in 2001, when he was a reporter with Surya TV in Thiruvananthapuram.

For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App.","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - At 19, Sandy Saputra is big on TikTok Indonesia. Within a year, he’s leapt from quiet, small-town life to star influencer status as more than 10.5 million followers lap up his toothy grin in dancing, pranking and lip-synching videos on the booming app. 
Sandy’s success, becoming his family’s main breadwinner as global brands like Coca Cola or Suntory pay to have their names on his light-hearted clips, comes as TikTok mushrooms across Southeast Asia. Data trackers show it’s been downloaded hundreds of millions of times already in a region with a collective population of 630 million - half of them under 30. 
But it also comes as concerns over how secure user data is in the hands of its Chinese owner ByteDance summon big storm clouds elsewhere - TikTok has been banned in India and President Donald Trump has ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations, triggering the resignation on Thursday of only recently installed CEO Kevin Mayer. 
Southeast Asia offers a clear view of the global strategy ByteDance is implementing to avoid crackdowns in other regions that influencers like Saputra now fear. The approach is to launch ‘non-political’ products fast, promising to governments in places like Vietnam that content will be tightly policed in accordance with local laws, according to interviews with a dozen current and former employees. 
The region is now key to the future of TikTok and ByteDance: The Chinese firm is already plugging TikTok as part of a suite of interconnected apps for live video streaming, messaging and music, tackling U.S. behemoths Facebook and Google head on as both pour billions into Southeast Asia. 
ByteDance declined to comment for this article, and it’s unclear whether or how the prospective sale of operations in the United States and elsewhere might effect Southeast Asia. But in his base in Sukabumi, West Java province, Saputra is only too aware of risks. 
""Of course I do think about it ... It would be so disappointing if TikTok was erased from Indonesia,"" Saputra told Reuters, speaking before filming a sketch www.tiktok.com/@sandys.ss in a paddy field. 
“It wasn’t planned out. I was an ordinary person, making videos like any other normal person, who didn’t have an idea on how this would play out,” said Saputra, now adding hundreds of thousands of TikTok followers every week. 
SISTER APPS 
In the meantime, TikTok is ploughing ahead testing ‘creator’ marketplaces across the region, championing influencers like Saputra, and negotiating data deals with telecoms firms to keep a lid on consumers’ smartphone bills, according to interviews with current and former staffers. 
It’s chasing small to medium-sized businesses as advertisers - nearly nine out of every 10 firms in Southeast Asia are classified as small - complete with how-to-advertise seminars, millions of dollars in advertising credits, and a self-service platform for businesses to make their own ads. 
TikTok is piloting live-streaming commercial initiatives pioneered in China, Southeast Asia business marketing head Chew Wee Ng said in an interview with Reuters. Meanwhile ByteDance is heavily promoting sister apps like Singapore-headquartered business messaging service Lark and music streaming service Resso. 
“TikTok is really unique in that people expect to see advertisers and they want to co-create with brands,” said Ng, a former Google executive based in Singapore. 
According to data from app analytics firm Sensor Tower, TikTok has had more than 360 millions downloads in Southeast Asia, nearly half of them in Indonesia, with 151% growth year-on-year for 2020. 
An internal ByteDance 2019 presentation reviewed by Reuters showed that last year TikTok had 43.5 million monthly active users in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, with the majority female, the biggest online consumers in the region. 
The app grew staggeringly fast in recent months, sources said, as lockdowns enforced across the region to tackle the coronavirus pandemic forced people to stay home. In Indonesia, Saputra said he’s been acquiring 100,000 followers every three days. 
LOCAL MODERATORS 
With growth has come increased government scrutiny, but ByteDance has already had plenty of experience dealing with that. As on other business matters, ByteDance declined to comment on its handling of scrutiny. 
Indonesia presented one of its first major global policy challenges in 2018, after authorities briefly banned TikTok for posts they said contained “pornography, inappropriate content and blasphemy”. 
Within 24 hours, the firm had dispatched senior executives to negotiate with Indonesia, promising to raise the age of its users and to hire a team of local moderators, according to sources and to the-then Indonesian communications minister. 
It would quickly copy this approach by installing moderators across its Southeast Asian markets in a bid to insure compliance with local laws. 
Reuters reported in August that from 2018 until 2020, ByteDance censored content that it perceived as critical of the Chinese government on a news aggregator app in Indonesia known as BaBe at the behest of ByteDance’s China headquarters. 
As of August 2020, most of the content guidelines have been localised for individual Southeast Asian countries. That has often meant strict censorship of local political content. 
In Thailand, where a youth protest movement is challenging the country’s monarchy, some users told Reuters their pro-protest videos had been taken down. [L4N2FK2IX] 
‘IN VIETNAM, CHINA IS POLITICAL’ 
In Vietnam, TikTok has blocked most political content for years, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company declined to comment. 
Hanoi has been in a long-running conflict with U.S. tech giants over demands to restrict any content deemed against the state and create local offices in Vietnam. 
Reuters reported in April that Facebook agreed to increase censorship of “anti-state” posts in Vietnam after its local servers were temporarily taken off-line. [L3N2CA1L0] 
ByteDance, which unlike big U.S. tech players does have an office in the country, decided to pre-empt issues with the government by promising to make its app ‘non-political’. 
Due to Vietnam’s contentious relationship with China, ByteDance decided it would also ban content critical of Beijing, and anything related to tensions between the two governments. 
“In Vietnam, China is political,” one source said. 
The approach has been effective. TikTok now counts Vietnam, a multi-billion dollar market for social media firms, as among its most profitable in Asia, according to sources with knowledge of the matter, while launching regular campaigns with authorities on safety and tourism. 
Back in West Java, Sandy Saputra aims to keep on flashing grins and goofing around on TikTok. 
“To me, this isn’t a job,” he said, before breaking away into another dance routine. “It’s a hobby that makes money.”

The airlines said it will fly thrice a week between the two cities from August 28 to October 24. Vistara's new Delhi-London flight was a part of bilateral ""transport bubble"" pact signed between India and the United Kingdom.""This marks our foray into long haul operations and we are excited to announce that London is now a Vistara City,"" the budget airlines stated on social media site. 
The first Delhi-London flight was operated with its new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. Vistara previously said it sought permission to operate flights to Paris and Frankfurt. 
""Were delighted to welcome our newest entrant to Terminal 2 today,"" Heathrow Airport wrote on Twitter. Heathrow Airport is one of the major international airports in London. 
India suspended international flight operations in the country on March 25 in the wake of coronavirus outbreak. Later, the central government allowed special flights under Vande Bharat Mission to bring back stranded Indians from the foreign countries.
In July, the Central government established special transport bubbles with several countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Maldives to operate international flights. The ministry of civil aviation earlier said India is in talks with 13 more countries to have an air travel bubble agreement. These countries are Australia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Nigeria, Bahrain, Israel, Kenya, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand.

There were no reports of casualties on either side. 
Israel’s military said it struck underground infrastructure and a military post belonging to Gaza’s Islamist rulers Hamas overnight in response to incendiary balloons launched from the Palestinian enclave that have burned Israeli farmland. 
Gaza militants then fired six rockets towards Israel, the military said, drawing a second round of Israeli strikes which hit a Hamas armed training camp. 
An Israeli military spokesman said he did not have any information on where the Gaza rockets landed, but that none of them were intercepted by its Iron Dome system. 
Hamas has been trying to pressure Israel to ease its blockade of Gaza and allow more investment, in part by letting Palestinians launch dozens of helium balloons carrying incendiary material towards southern Israel in recent weeks. 
Mediators from the United Nations, Egypt and Qatar have been working to restore calm. Qatari envoy Mohammad Al-Emadi has been in Gaza since Tuesday holding talks with Hamas leaders. 
Israel has struck Hamas facilities almost nightly for the past two weeks, saying it would not tolerate the balloons. 
With tension high, Israel has closed its only commercial crossing with Gaza, banned sea access and halted fuel imports into the coastal strip, leading to its only power plant shutting down last week. 
Health officials have voiced concern that the power plant shut-down could aggravate a novel coronavirus outbreak in impoverished Gaza, which is home to 2 million Palestinians.

2031687,0,0,At least two students killed during exams in eastern Congo - Reuters Africa,"‘Pained’: PM Modi tweets to ‘dear friend’ Shinzo Abe, praises his leadership - Hindustan Times","GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - At least two students and a teacher were killed and several other teachers kidnapped after a primary school holding exams was attacked by unidentified gunmen in eastern Congo, authorities and the United Nations said on Friday. 
Exact details of the attack and the number of casualties remained unclear. 
Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi said two students died when fighting broke out in North Kivu province on Thursday morning. He did not give further details. 
Cosmas Kangakolo, an administrator for Masisi territory, said the Ngoyi Primary School was attacked. He said one teacher died and several were kidnapped. 
Exam centres in the area are protected by the army, Kangakolo said, because of endemic security problems. 
The United Nations children’s fund said in a statement the clashes took place between law enforcement and an armed group close to the exam centre. It was not clear whether the students were targets of the fighting or caught in cross-fire. 
Rich in fertile soils and natural resources but awash with weapons, large portions of eastern Congo continue to suffer from chronic instability following the 1998-2003 war in which millions of people died. 
Violence has flared in recent months with armed groups killing more than 1,300 people in the first half of 2020, three times more than the previous year. 
Reporting by Fiston Mahamba and Stanis Bujakera; Editing by Hereward Holland and Mark Potter","Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who shares personal chemistry with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said he was “pained” to hear about the outgoing Japan prime minister’s ill health and credited him for cementing relations between the two countries.
PM Modi tweeted to PM Abe hours after the Japanese prime minister announced his decision to resign from the top post due to his health condition. “Pained to hear about your ill health, my dear friend @AbeShinzo,” PM Modi said in a tweet.

PM Modi also tweeted a 2018 photograph of the two leaders at an informal meeting during the 13th India-Japan Summit that took place at a resort near Mount Fuji in Japan in October 2018.
The next summit level meeting was scheduled to be held in December in Assam’s Guwahati but was deferred due to the protests against the anti-citizenship law. PM Abe and PM Modi were expected to hold the 14th India-Japan Summit via video conference on 10 September. But there is no clarity if the two countries, who were expected to seal a crucial military logistics pact, would be able to stick to this schedule in view of PM Abe’s health condition.
PM Modi credited PM Abe with playing a lead role in strengthening relations between the two countries. “In recent years, with your wise leadership and personal commitment, the India-Japan partnership has become deeper and stronger than ever before. I wish and pray for your speedy recovery,” PM  Modi said.
PM Modi is known to have been an admirer of the Japanese prime minister long before he moved from Gujarat to New Delhi in 2014. By all accounts, it was mutual. 
PM Abe was one of the first global leaders to congratulate Narendra Modi for his gigantic victory in 2014 well before all the votes were counted. Modi was also only one of the three people that PM Abe followed on Twitter back then. That number has still gone up to 18. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has been the other addition from India since then. As prime minister, Modi had made Japan his first port of call outside south Asia in September 2014 once he assumed charge in New Delhi.
PM Abe’s announcement to step down comes just days after he surpassed a record for longest consecutive tenure as premier set by his great-uncle Eisaku Sato half a century ago. He had then stressed that what was important was what a leader did in the top post, not the duration.
As PM Abe announced his decision to exit the government at a news conference on Thursday, he underlined that he could not be the prime minister if he could not make the best decisions for the people.
“I cannot be prime minister if I cannot make the best decisions for the people. I have decided to step down from my post,” Abe, 65, told a news conference.
Abe has battled the disease ulcerative colitis for years and two recent hospital visits within a week had fanned questions on whether he could stay in the job until the end of his term as ruling party leader, and hence, premier, in September 2021.",https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN25O2G5-OZATP,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pained-to-hear-about-your-ill-health-pm-modi-wishes-speedy-recovery-to-shinzo-abe/story-pv0AL4qnZul6L7S0CdnZFP.html

(Express Photo/ Jasbir Malhi) A truncated sitting of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha’s monsoon session was held on Friday in view of the coronaviruspandemic with important business not being transacted in order to keep the proceedings short. SAD MLAs skipped it while several AAP MLAs, including Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, were not allowed inside.
The House was adjourned for one hour after the obituary references and as soon as it re-assembled, Speaker Rana K P Singh read the recommendation of the Business Advisory Committee regarding suspension of business.
This house resolves that due to the prevailing circumstances on account of the Covid-19, the current session of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha has been called under sepcial circumstances, therefore, during this session only urgent and important government business be transacted and no other business whatsoever including questions, calling attention notices and any other business to be initiated by a private member be brought before or transacted in the house during the session and all relevant rules on the subject in the rules of procedure and conduct of business in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha do hereby stand suspended to that extent,a resolution passed to this effect said.
Former Speaker of Punjab Vidhan Sabha Charanjit Singh Atwal said that it is in the power of the Speaker to suspend any business. It may have happened in Punjab earlier. It sometimes happens when we call an emergency session we suspend question hour, supplementary or even all rules, Atwal said.
However, former Deputy Speaker of the Vidhan Sabha Bir Devinder Singh said the truncated session, doing away of important business and keeping away the Leader of Opposition is unprecedented.
No, it has never happened earlier. It was a theatre of the absurd. A lot of traditions have been compromised in this session and the Speaker has acted very arbitrarily. Question hour cannot be done away with. It is clear that the session was held only to fulfil constitutional obligation. Had that not been so, the Congress would not have held it at all. It is all very sad, he said.
The Leader of Opposition, Harpal Singh Cheema, Deputy Leader of the party in the House, Sarvjeet Kaur Manuke and Barnala MLA Meet Hayer, were not allowed to enter the House. Speaking inside the House, Sunam MLA Aman Arora said that the three were debarred from entering into the House on frivolous grounds.
Cheema ji was stopped saying that his driver has not been tested, Manuke ji was told her husband has not been tested, Meet Hayer was told that his gunman had not been tested. However, when we received instructions from you (Speaker) regarding the session, all these things were not mentioned. We were only told about bringing a Covid negative report, Arora said.
Only five AAP legislators, Kultar Singh Sandhwan, Baljinder Kaur, Aman Arora, Jai Kishan Rori and Baldev Singh, were allowed to attend the session. However, rebel MLAs, including suspended Kharar MLA Kanwar Sandhu, were present in the House.
Speaking outside the House, Cheema said that the state government had deployed heavy police force outside his house as well as the houses of other opposition leaders. Capt Amarinder Singh is acting like a dictator.”
Cheema, Hayer and Manuke held a protest outside the Assembly, when they were not being allowed to attend the session. All three along with Aman Arora came wearing PPE suits.
Later, the AAP MLAs accompanied by state president of the party Bhagwant Mann sat on dharna outside the Punjab Bhawan where the media was reporting the session and condemned the action of the Speaker in keeping the MLAs out of the House.
SAD legislators stayed away from the session even as the two BJP MLAs attended the session. “Murder of democracy by Cong govt. Now police force posted outside SAD MLAs’ houses to prevent them from attending 1 hr assembly session. Such kind of oppression seen for first even though SAD announced it will act responsibly. We appeal to Governor, Pb to intervene &amp; restore order,” SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia said in a tweet.

For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App.","Delhi has yet again been spared an increase in electricity rates by the regulator, fifth year in a row. The new tariff schedule will be applicable from 1 September.The tariff levels for the year to March will remain unchanged primarily because the regulator didnt consider any revenue increase for the distribution firmsBSES Rajdhani Power Ltd (BRPL), BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL), Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL), and New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) on account of the coronavirus pandemic.
While the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) increased the pension trust surcharge from the 3.80% to 5% for the erstwhile Delhi Vidyut Board employees, it waived off the 20% surcharge under time of day (ToD) tariff for September 2020 to provide relief to consumers.
This was for the first time that the DERC didnt conduct a public hearing for deciding the tariff rates in the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic. The process has assumed political overtones with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which came to power in Delhi, making lower electricity bills one of its electoral promises.
However, due to outbreak of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) which has been declared as a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) (GoNCTDs Notification No.F.51/DGHS/PH- IV/COVID19/2020/prsecyhfw/2393-2407 dated 13/03/2020), the Public Hearing which was scheduled on 18/03/2020 was cancelled,"" the DERC said in a press statement.
At the moment, electricity rates as approved by DERC for domestic consumers start at 3 per unit for consumption of up to 200 units, going up to Rs4.50 per unit for 200-400 units, Rs6.50 per unit for 400-800 units, Rs7 per unit for 800-1200 units, and Rs8 per unit for consumption beyond 1200 units.
Electricity has significant political ramifications, a fact established by the AAPmoves. Providing free power up to 200 units every month for households, a 50% subsidy on monthly power consumption of up to 400 units announced in 2015, and capping electricity tariff paid handsome dividends for AAP in the Delhi elections.
The Commission has waived off existing provision of 20% Surcharge under ToD Tariff for September 2020 in order to facilitate Non-Domestic, Industrial, Public Utilities and Domestic Consumers (optional) etc. in this COVID-19 situation,"" the statement added.
While India's electricity demand is recovering amid gradual lifting of the lockdown, it is yet to reach the pre-pandemic days. Delhis electricity demand touched an all-time high of 7,409 MW in July last year.
In order to promote pollution free transportation and clean environment, the Commission has decided to continue with the subsidized tariff rates for E-Rickshaw/E-Vehicle category,"" the statement said.
This comes in the backdrop of the Delhi government announcement of incentivising purchase of electric vehicles with benefits of up to Rs30,000 for two-wheelers and Rs1.5 lakh for cars.
Tariff for charging stations for E-Rickshaw/E-vehicle on single point delivery as notified in this Tariff Schedule shall also be applicable for charging of batteries at swapping facilities provided that such swapping facilities are exclusively used for swapping of batteries of E-Rickshaw/E-Vehicle only,"" the statement added.
Delhi policy on electric vehicles (EVs) focuses on two-wheelers, four-wheelers, shared transport vehicles, and commercial vehicles to lead the change to electric mobility. The government aims to have 25% of the cars registered to be EVs by 2024.

Rajnath Singh and Wei Fenghe. (File)Defence Minister Rajnath Singh is likely to travel to Moscow for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Defence Ministers meeting on September 3 and 4, sources said on Friday. This will be his second visit to Moscow since the border stand-off with China began in early May.
Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu on Friday told the Indian ambassador in Moscow, D B Venkatesh Varma, that he looked forward to meeting Singh in Moscow next week. Shoigu conveyed this at the India Defence Pavilion at Kubinka outside Moscow.
This will be an opportunity for Singh to also meet his Chinese counterpart Wei Fenghe, who is also likely to attend the SCO Defence Ministers meeting.
With Indian and Chinese soldiers locked in a border standoff for the last three-and-half months, this could provide an opportunity to resolve the situation.
On June 24, Singh and Wei had attended the military parade in Moscow to mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Germany in World War Two.
New Delhi is also considering sending External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to Russia next month, around September 9 to 11, where he will have the opportunity to meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and discuss steps to resolve the ongoing standoff.
If that works out, it will be their first in-person meeting, although the two have met via video conferencing during the Russia-India-China (RIC) Foreign Ministers meeting in June. They have also had a phone conversation on June 17, two days after the Galwan clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.
Before the SCO Foreign Ministers meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will chair a large-format meeting of BRICS foreign ministers on September 4, to be held via videoconference. At this meeting, views on topical international matters will be exchanged. This meet will be attended by Jaishankar and Wang, sources said.
Hectic diplomatic activity between New Delhi and Beijing is again gaining pace through Russian interlocutors. Ambassador Varma has been constantly in touch with Russian officials.
The Indian envoy also had a conversation with Deputy Minister in Russias Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov on Friday, in which topics of cooperation in multilateral associations and upcoming bilateral contacts at various levels were discussed, officials said.
Earlier this week, Raj Kumar, the Secretary of Defence Production, visited Moscow and held talks on the manufacturing in India the spare parts of Russian equipment supplied to India.
On the LAC stand-off, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Thursday had said that a complete disengagement requires re-deployment of troops by each side towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC.
It is natural that this can be done only through mutually agreed reciprocal actions. Thus it is important to bear in mind that achieving this requires agreed actions by both sides, he said.

For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App.","Sowing of kharif crops touched an all-time high area of 108.22 million hectares during the week ended August 28, raising hopes of a bumper harvest in excess of 149 million tonnes during the season.
 The last all-time high kharif acreage was in the kharif season of 2016, at 107.57 million hectares .
 A good kharif output could help tame overall retail inflation within the Reserve bank of India’s threshold band of 2-6 per cent in the months to come. Retail inflation since April has been hovering at 7 per cent largely due to high food prices.
 A question mark also remains on the demand to absorb this surplus production, and unless it picks up strongly in the months to come crop prices might collapse, hurting farmers immensely.
 Meanwhile, the area data showed that this year’s acreage of 108.22 million hectares is so far about 7.15 per cent more than that under kharif crops last year and 1.5 per cent beyond the average acreage of the past five years.
ALSO READ: Kharif sowing completed in over 95% of normal area, shows data
 “Sowing of rice is still continuing in some parts, while sowing of pulses, coarse cereals, bajra and oilseeds is almost over. We are confident that with so much acreage, over total foodgrains production in 2020-21 will cross the targeted 298.32 million tonnes,” agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said in a statement today.
 Though, agriculture ministry officials are confident of a bumper harvest due to record increase in kharif acreage, but experts and farmers said the on-ground situation in some crops is not that encouraging as incessant rains since the last few weeks and pest attack could impact the final yield particularly in early sown varieties.
 Like in Madhya Pradesh, state officials and traders are now saying that the main kharif crop of soybean could be atleast 10-15 per cent less than last year due to the massive stem fly attack.
 Similarly, in some parts of Central and Western India, the incessant rains since the early August could impact the final yield of pulses and oilseeds crops in those parts where the crop is submerged for an abnormally longer duration of time.
 Meanwhile, according to a preliminary assessment by the Indore-based Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA), the attack by pests such as stem fly might lead to 10-12 per cent drop in production in the state, but much will depend on the weather in the coming weeks.
 SOPA based its assessment on a survey conducted recently. 
It said the most affected districts are Indore, Dewas, Ujjain, Dhar, Sehore, Harda, Shajapur, Mandsaur and Neemuch in MP, although some damage is seen at other places also.
 Last week, SOPA estimated that India's soybean production could jump by 32per cent in 2020 to 12.25 million tonnes from a year earlier due to higher area under the oilseed and increased yields on ample monsoon rainfall.
 For Madhya Pradesh, it had estimated a 11.5 per cent rise in production to 5.8 million tonnes in 2020.
 After, the latest announcement, the actual production in 2020 could be much near last year’s level 5.2 million tonnes in MP.

 Though farmers and agriculture department officials have fanned out in the fields to control the pests, scientists said it is very difficult to revive the crop in those parts where the stem fly pest has already entered the shoot. Stem fly usually attacks if there is a long break in monsoon. Farmers said the sudden break in rains in July after the strong onset and progress in June has created perfect breeding grounds for the pest.
 “The stem fly attack in some soybean crop in Madhya Pradesh is among the severest in recent times and is largely due to sudden drop in moisture levels in the soil in the crucial growth month of July,” J K Kanojia, head of Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Sehore (MP) told Business Standard.
 The southwest monsoon in 2020 till August 28 is almost nine per cent more than normal. The rains, which were nearly 10 per cent below normal in July, picked up pace strongly thereafter and till a few weeks back, August rains were 24 per cent above normal.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rajnath-likely-to-visit-moscow-in-september-may-meet-chinese-counterpart-6574230/,https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/india-s-area-under-kharif-crops-hits-all-time-high-of-over-108-mn-hectares-120082801368_1.html
947415,0,0,"Wall St Week Ahead-Value bulls bang drum for cheap stock resurgence on Fed, vaccine hopes - Reuters","United States to hold high-level talks with Australia, Japan and India","NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - As U.S. stocks hit record highs, some investors are betting the market’s future gains will be increasingly driven by some of its lesser-loved companies. 
Value stocks - shares of economically sensitive companies trading at multiples that are usually below those found on growth names - have been among the laggards in the market’s blistering rally from its March lows. 
Some investors believe the relative cheapness of value stocks, which include energy companies, banks and industrial conglomerates, will catapult them to leadership if the nascent U.S. economic revival gains momentum, shifting focus from the big technology-related stocks that have led markets during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Russell 1000 Value index trades at almost 18 times earnings, up from 14 a year ago, and is up some 45% since late March. By comparison, the Russell 1000 Growth index trades at a multiple of 31, up from 22, and has gained over 70% in the same period. 
“It’s an important part of validating the market’s rise, to have cyclicals and value sectors move,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. 
“At the end of the day I think value can outperform, but it’s going to be very episodic.” 
Hopes of economic healing got a second wind Thursday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell rolled out a sweeping policy rewrite that puts more focus on fighting unemployment than controlling inflation, sending shares of banks like Wells Fargo and Citigroup higher on the day. 
Investors in the coming week will be keeping a close eye on Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls data, looking for a snapshot of how the country’s economic recovery is faring. 
Other arguments for a value resurgence have been fueled by signs of progress on a vaccine against COVID-19, which some investors believe could accelerate business reopenings and a return to in-person schooling across the United States. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has said a vaccine for the novel coronavirus could be available before the Nov. 3 presidential election, sooner than most experts anticipate. 
Some analysts, including those at Goldman Sachs, believe a vaccine could be approved as early as the end of this year. 
That could take the S&amp;P 500 as high as 3,700 by year-end and spur a rotation to value names, especially if the news flow regarding a vaccine continues to be encouraging, Goldman’s analysts said earlier this month. The index recently hovered near 3,500. 
Plenty of market participants doubt value will return anytime soon, or that such a move can be timed profitably. 
Value sectors such as retail have struggled for years with lackluster earnings or business models that are being disrupted in a shift to a more tech-driven world, a process that accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic. 
“Valuation alone doesn’t drive stock prices. It’s the combination of valuation and improving fundamentals,” said Richard Bernstein, chief executive officer and chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors in New York. 
“For value to outperform, one typically needs profit growth to accelerate. That’s not happening yet,” he said. 
BofA Global Research points out that value stocks have led during the recovery from every one of the last 14 recessions. 
Yet it also warns of “value traps” - stocks whose prices are falling faster than earnings are deteriorating. Such stocks have underperformed broader markets by four percentage points a year since 1997, the bank said. 
BofA’s model identified energy and brick-and-mortar retail as sectors where value traps can be found. 
Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, believes resurgences in value may be a thing of the past. 
Technology has transformed the way companies deal with their inventory and altered the business cycle, sapping the benefits cyclical companies would receive from an upswing in growth, she said. 
“There are some dinosaurs that don’t get that the comet has hit and the (investment) environment has changed,” said Forrest. 
Others, like Bill Smead of Smead Capital Management, remain hopeful. 
An eventual rise in inflation could boost the shares of energy companies, banks and home builders, which have tended to perform better when consumer prices trend higher, Smead said in a note to investors. 
Even longtime value bulls like Smead can have their fortitude tested, however. 
“We are patient, but that patience doesn’t last forever,” he wrote.

Andrea Ricci","WASHINGTON: The United States plans high-level talks with ""Quad"" security partners from India, Australia and Japan in September and October, President Donald Trump's national security adviser said on Friday, while criticizing ""very aggressive"" behavior by China.
Robert O'Brien told the Atlantic Council think tank he would likely meet his opposite numbers from those countries in Hawaii in October, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would meet his counterparts from the so-called Quad in September and October.
O'Brien said the United States had an ""amazing amount of stake"" in the Indo-Pacific region.
""It's really the engine of the world economy going forward and America's gonna play a big role there. One of the ways that we can do that is providing for a safe and secure Indo-Pacific through our defense partnerships and our diplomatic partnerships with our allies,"" he said.
O'Brien said the Quad relationship, which has been denounced by China, was coming into its own and likely to pay huge dividends.
""We're seeing a very assertive, a very aggressive China and the United States is not going to back down from its long-held principles that the world's ocean ways and international waters should be free for navigation, and the same with space and with air rights and international airspace,"" he said.
U.S.-China tension has risen in the run-up to the U.S. election in November and the countries' military forces have stepped up activities in the Indo-Pacific region.
On Thursday, the Pentagon expressed concern about China's recent military exercises, including the firing of medium-range ballistic missiles in the South China Sea.
China criticized a U.S. warship operation near the Paracel Islands, which China claims, along with most of the sea.

1483896,0,0,Pakistan jails three accused of financing Mumbai attacks - Reuters,"Teen charged in Kenosha fatal shooting that killed 2 protestors, hurt 1","LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A court in Pakistan has sentenced to prison three leaders of Jamat-ud-Dawa, an organisation accused by India and the United States of masterminding the 2008 attacks in Mumbai. 
The sentencing comes ahead of a September deadline for Pakistan to avoid being blacklisted for failing to curb terror financing by global financial watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). 
Inclusion on the blacklist, alongside Iran and North Korea, would mean being shunned by international financial institutions. The watchdog has called for Pakistan to prosecute those funding terrorism, as well as to enact laws to help track and stop terror financing. 
Malik Zafar Iqbal and Abdul Salam were each handed 16-1/2 year total sentences on four charges, to be served concurrently, while a third man, Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki, got 1-1/2 years on one charge, according to a court judgment seen by Reuters. 
The men were associates of Hafiz Saeed, who was sentenced to a total of 11 years in prison in February. All the sentences are concurrent so Saeed, Iqbal and Salam will serve five years. 
Saeed founded and led Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), or the Army of the Pure, a group blamed by India and the United States for the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which killed 160 people, including Americans and other foreigners. 
Saeed and his associates also face a further slew of cases for allegedly financing militant activities, while Iqbal and Makki have already been convicted in several cases. 
Saeed says his network, which spans 300 seminaries and schools, hospitals, a publishing house and ambulance services, has no ties to militant groups. Jamat-ud-Dawa funds the militant wing LeT. 
A 2011 U.S. sanctions designation describes Iqbal as a co-founder of LeT and in charge of its financing activities. Salam is described as the interim leader of the group during the brief periods when Saeed was arrested in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks, and running its network of seminaries. 
Writing and additional reporting by Umar Farooq; Editing by David Holmes","Prosecutors on Thursday charged a 17-year-old from Illinois in the fatal shooting of two protesters and the wounding of a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin, during a night of unrest following the weekend police shooting of Jacob Blake.
Kyle Rittenhouse faces charges of first-degree intentional homicide, one count of first-degree reckless homicide, one count of attempted first-degree intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment.
He would face a mandatory life sentence if convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, the most serious crime in Wisconsin.
The shootings late Tuesday largely caught on cellphone video and posted online and the shooting by police Sunday of Blake, a 29-year-old Black father of six who was left paralyzed from the waist down, made Kenosha the latest focal point in the fight against racial injustice that has gripped the country since the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.
The two men killed were Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, and Anthony Huber, 26, of Silver Lake, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of the city.
A third man was injured. Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, of West Allis, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Kenosha is recovering after surgery, said Bethany Crevensten, another activist. She said Grosskreutz was volunteering as a medic when he was shot and called him a hero.
Rosenbaum was shot and killed first, after following Rittenhouse into a used car lot, where he threw a plastic bag at the gunman and attempted to take the weapon from him, according to a criminal complaint released by prosecutors Thursday.
The medical examiner found that Rosenbaum was shot in the groin and back which fractured his pelvis and perforated his right lung and liver and his left hand. He also suffered a superficial wound to his left thigh and a graze wound to his forehead.
Rittenouse then ran down the street and was chased by several people shouting that he just shot someone before he tripped and fell, according to the complaint and cellphone footage. Huber, who was carrying a skateboard, was shot in the chest after apparently trying to wrest the gun from Rittenhouse, the complaint said.
Grosskreutz, who appeared to be holding a gun, then was shot in the left arm after approaching Rittenhouse, the complaint said. Rittenhouse's attorney, Lin Wood, said the teenager was acting in self-defence.
From my standpoint, it's important that the message be clear to other Americans who are attacked that there will be legal resources available in the event false charges are brought against them, he said.

3032562,0,0,U.S. consumer spending rises solidly  income rebounds - Reuters India,"Will produce Covid vaccine by this year end or sooner, says Donald Trump – Livemint","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected in July, strengthening expectations for a sharp rebound in economic growth in the third quarter, though momentum is likely to ebb as the COVID-19 pandemic lingers and fiscal stimulus dries up. 
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed a rise in personal income after two straight monthly declines, while monthly inflation pushed higher. The Federal Reserve on Thursday rolled out a sweeping rewrite of its mandate, putting new weight on the U.S. labor market and less on worries about too-high inflation. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 1.9% last month, after jumping 6.2% in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending gaining 1.5% in July. 
Consumers boosted spending on goods like new motor vehicles. Spending on goods has rebounded above pre-pandemic levels. They also lifted spending on healthcare, dining out and on hotel and motel accommodation. Still, outlays on services are below February levels as consumers remain wary of exposure to the virus. 
That is a bad omen for the services-based economy, which slipped into recession in February. Though new COVID-19 infections have subsided after a broad resurgence through the summer, many hot spots remain, especially at college campuses that have reopened for in-person learning. 
The economy suffered its deepest contraction in at least 73 years in the second quarter, with consumer spending at the forefront of the decline in gross domestic product. 
While economists are anticipating a sharp rebound in GDP in the third quarter, led by consumer spending, they are cutting estimates for the fourth quarter. 
RETAIL INVENTORIES REBOUND 
Prospects for third-quarter GDP growth were boosted by another report from the Commerce Department on Friday showing a rebound in retail inventories in July. That could offset a potential drag from rising imports, which led to a widening in the goods trade deficit last month. 
U.S. stocks were trading higher as the prospect of super low interest rates for a prolonged period spurred risk appetite. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
Americans in low-wage jobs have borne the brunt of the economic downturn. A $600 weekly unemployment supplement from the government expired on July 31. Though President Donald Trump extended the supplement, the payout was cut to $300 per week and funding for the program is expected to be depleted by September. 
A few states are offering the extra unemployment benefit. Economists estimate the loss of the $600 could cut $50 billion from retail sales in August. At least 27 million people are on unemployment benefits. 
Last month, income rose 0.4% amid an increase in wages as more businesses reopened, offsetting a decrease in government transfer payments. Income fell 1.0% in June. Wages gained 1.3% after increasing 2.2% in June. 
With spending heavily tilted towards goods, monthly inflation increased further in July. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3% after surging 0.5% in June. In the 12 months through July the PCE price index increased 1.0% after gaining 0.9% in June. 
Prices excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.3%, matching June’s advance. In the 12 months through July, the so-called core PCE price index climbed 1.3% after increasing 1.1% in June. The core PCE index is the preferred inflation measure for the Fed’s 2% target, which is now a flexible average.

4703535,0,0,Housing ministry advises states to reduce stamp duty on property transactions,ICICI Bank divests 6.44 million ICICI Securities shares in open market to meet SEBI guidelines,"New Delhi: Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra on Friday hailed the Maharashtra government's decision to reduce stamp duty on registration of properties and advised other states to do the same to boost demand in the real estate sector.
Addressing a webinar organised by industry body PHDCCI, he assured the industry that the ministry would examine its various demands, including one regarding need for a change in income tax law to enable builders reduce their selling prices of apartments.
The secretary said an investment of Rs 9,300 crore has been approved from the Rs 25,000-crore stress fund, which was set up to complete the stalled housing projects across the country.
On the demand for stamp duty reduction to boost sluggish sales during this COVID-19 pandemic, Mishra said, ""We had given suggestions to all the states to reduce it. The Maharashtra government has done it. We will pursue with others (states). It's a good step by the Maharashtra government. It will have a positive impact on cost reduction.""
On Wednesday, the Maharashtra government decided to slash stamp duty on sale deed documents by 3 per cent from September 1 to December 31, 2020, and by 2 per cent from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021. Currently, the rate is 5 per cent in urban area and 4 per cent in rural area.
Stamp duty is the transactional tax, collected by the government on property purchases. It is one of the major sources of revenue.
Mishra asked the industry to send its suggestion related to change in the income tax law for enabling builders to reduce prices without incurring any tax liabilities.
Gaurs Group Managing Director Manoj Gaur said if builders reduce prices more than 10 per cent below ready reckoner rates, there is an additional tax burden on developers and also buyers.
""We will examine your suggestion. If we are satisfied, we will take up this issue with the finance ministry,"" Mishra said.
The secretary said there has been considerable improvement in ease of doing business in the real estate sector and construction permits are being given online.
Mishra also clarified that public sector companies and development authorities involved in building and selling real estate projects would have to be registered under the RERA law.
On the newly launched Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHC) scheme for migrants and urban poor, he said this would be a game changer in creating market for rental housing.
Mishra said the government has finalised model tenancy law and is likely to be approved in the next one months. It will then be sent to states/UTs for adoption.
The model tenancy law has been further simplified compared to the draft proposal, he said.
The ministry had in July 2019 floated the draft model tenancy law, which proposed that landowners will have to give a notice in writing three months before revising rent. It advocated appointing a district collector as rent authority and heavy penalty on tenants for overstaying.
Last month, the Union Cabinet approved this ARHC scheme, under which existing vacant government-funded housing complexes will be converted into Affordable Rental Housing Complexes through ""concession agreements"" for 25 years. ARHC is a sub-scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban.
The concessionaire will make the complexes livable by repair or retrofit and maintenance of rooms and filling up infrastructure gaps such as water, sewer, sanitation, road and related work.
Earlier, PHDCCI President D K Aggarwal demanded reduction in stamp duty and GST as well as infrastructure status for the entire real estate industry. He also suggested to increase the size of stress fund to Rs 1 lakh crore from the current Rs 25,000 crore.","A security guard wearing a protective mask stands at the entrance to an ICICI Bank Ltd. branch in a near-empty Connaught Place during a partial lockdown imposed due to the coronavirus in New Delhi, India, on Thursday, May 14, 2020.

""This election will decide whether we save the American dream"" or whether ""we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny,"" Trump, 74, said on Thursday amidst cheers from some 1,500 ardent supporters who were mostly maskless.
My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States,"" he said in his 70-minute address from the South Lawn of the White House as hundreds of protesters staged a noisy demonstration outside against his policies.
I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years, Trump said.
In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity! he said.
""We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before,"" he told the Americans as the country has witnessed over 180,000 deaths and over five million COVID-19 infections, making the the US the worst-hit nation.
Party's delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Trump and Pence are being challenged in the November 3 elections by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris.
Trump slammed Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness.
""He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness.""
Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history, Trump said.
The president said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered.
This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas, he said.
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens.
And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it, he said.
""Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism,"" he said.
Trump also referred to violent racial justice protests that have swept the nation in recent months following the killings of Black Americans.
The president said the Democrats at their party convention last week had disparaged America as a place of racial, social and economic injustice.
""So tonight I ask you a very simple question - how can the Democrat party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?
""In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins,"" Trump said.
Attacking his opponent's decades-long political life, Trump said: ""Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars.""
China, Trump said, would ""own our country"" if Biden wins and that only he would hold Beijing accountable for the ""tragedy they caused"" over the COVID-19.
Meanwhile, in an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump's acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party.
Earlier, Trump was introduced by one of his daughters, Ivanka, who said her father did not come to Washington to win praise from the Beltway elites, but to ""make America great again"".
""Washington has not changed Donald Trump.Donald Trump has changed Washington,"" she said.
Biden's running mate, Harris, delivered a speech hours before the president spoke, declaring: ""Donald Trump doesn't understand the presidency.""
""Donald Trump has failed at the most basic and important job of a president of the United States: he failed to protect the American people, plain and simple,"" the Indian-American senator said.

SEOUL, Aug 28 (Reuters) - South Korea’s exports likely shrunk for a sixth straight month in August, as effects from fewer working days outweighed a gradual recovery in global demand as more countries relax coronavirus lockdowns, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. 
August shipments were expected to have contracted 11.5% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of a Reuters poll of 11 economists, compared with a 7.0% drop in preliminary data for the first 20 days of the month and a 7.1% decline in July. 
There were 22 working days in August, 1.5 days less than last year. 
“The sharper decline in August exports is due to fewer working days ... The average per-day exports, however, were seen shrinking at a slower pace, underpinning continued recovery momentum,” said Lee Sang-jae, economist at Eugene Investment &amp; Securities. 
Other economists also believe exports are slowly turning the corner, given improving demand from the nation’s major trading partners China and the United States, particularly for electronics. 
South Korea’s economy relies heavily on trade, with exports and imports accounting for 63.7% of its 2019 nominal GDP. 
On Thursday, the Bank of Korea sharply downgraded its 2020 economic projection to a 1.3% contraction, the worst in more than two decades, from a previous forecast for a 0.2% decline, given a resurgence in virus infections. 
South Korea has reported triple-digit daily jumps in new cases for over two weeks, but the government stopped short of shifting the country up to the highest level of social distancing measures on Friday, as it stood cautious about further economic fallout. 
August imports were expected to tumble 15.2% year-on-year, far worse than a 11.6% plunge in July. 
“Imports will continue to shrink by a double-digit rate as a resurgence in coronavirus slows recovery in domestic demand,” said Ha Keon-hyeong, Shinhan Investment Corp economist. 
Meanwhile, 10 economists predicted industrial output in July would rise by a seasonally adjusted 1.9% month-on-month, slower than 7.2% in June, but they worry data going forward may worsen, reflecting the virus spread. 
Ten economists also estimated consumer prices would rise a median 0.4% in August from a year earlier, faster than 0.3% in the previous month.

Whether as a winger, centre-forward, False 9, striker or an attacking midfielder, the Argentine mega star can blend into any role without disrupting the balance of a formation.
The reality, though, is that only a handful of clubs could afford him. Even if his transfer fee plummets from the astronomical £700 million stuck in his release clause, his wages, close to £95 million a year, is unviable for most clubs.
However, if for once wage discussions are put on hold, and discussion about the expected Messi switch are based on pure footballing logic, several delicious options are thrown up.
In a fantasy world, where money isn’t the prime mover and egos don’t exist, Messi is best suited to join the Champions League winner Bayern Munich. Here’s how along with the other options.
PSG: A reunion with Neymar
Messi thought he had found a spiritual heir in Neymar during the Brazilian star’s years in Barcelona. His departure to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017, several Spanish newspapers claim, sparked the beginnings of the friction between Messi and the Barcelona board.
They could now unite at PSG, and with Kylian Mbappe, they could form a fearsome trio. The Frenchmans pace, Neymars wizardry and Messis intelligence could fetch them the elusive European crown.
Messi’s addition could unshackle Neymar, who has been thrust with a very heavy burden, just as Neymar could liberate Messi from the weight of carrying a fractured Barcelona side. The pair could operate just behind Mbappe in a fluid 4-3-2-1 formation, or in a wider 4-3-3, interchange flanks and roles, filling up each others space, and wreak pure havoc on backlines.
It would offer PSG considerable tactical flexibility up front, with the option of using Messi as a ‘False 9’ essentially a striker who drops deep into the midfield too. The two most versatile forwards operating in collusion is a match made in football heaven. Its no mere coincidence the best of Messi in recent times has come with Neymar by his side and vice versa.
BAYERN MUNICH: With the champions
Messi could change the rampaging European champions into a trophy-crunching beast. Their high-pressing game, with emphasis on quick transitions, would be further invigorated by Messis inclusion.
Often for Barcelona, the pressing, whenever they lost possession, would begin with Messi. So hes no stranger to this style, and he would be only delighted to collaborate with Robert Lewandowski, arguably the sharpest poacher around.
Contrary to popular perceptions, Messi likes playing with an out-and-out cerebral striker, who can cleverly sneak behind defensive lines.
Moreover, there is no fear of Messi encroaching into the space of others. Sergio Gnabry likes to operate from wide positions, while Muller is not unused to playing centrally with another attacking forward by his side. Germany has deployed Muller side by side with Lukas Podolski or Marcos Reus. The Germans ability to find space and operate in congested channels would endear itself to Messi, who has in the past expressed admiration of Muller.
Messi could also be employed as a right-sided forward in what could be a throwback to the Messi-David Villa days. His addition to the German club will be like a dash of glitter on a finished jigsaw puzzle.
It is, indeed, the best option.

In Pep Guardiolas Barcelona tenure, Lionel Messi redefined the False 9 so effectively that the role became a rage. Messi would drop deep and pull wide to link the play and disrupt opponents’ marking structures.
It then allowed Barcelona to get more men higher up the pitch quickly, facilitating pressing and ball-winning, the fundamental principles of Barcelonas game.
Liverpool plays differently, but Jürgen Klopp has deputed False 9 in several important games. The results were a mixed bag, but it was not due to the inefficiency of the system, rather because of the incompetence of the personnel.
Messi is an upgrade several times over on Roberto Firmino and Georginio Wijnaldum. The prospect is mouthwatering Sadio Mane scything from the left and Mohammad Salah skittering from the right, and converging into Messi. He could orchestrate lightning transitions where Mane and Salah could stir havoc. Messis presence would not hamper Firmino either, as the Brazilian is happy to drop deep and link the play between the midfield and his fellow forwards.
Also in Explained:What is the clause Lionel Messi triggered to leave Barcelona?
REAL MADRID: Masters at work
This is an improbable union. Messi would rather retire than turn up for Barcelonas bitter antagonists.
But just imagine Zinedine Zidane managing Messi, the confluence of the games immortals, or the prospect of plotting alongside Eden Hazard, buzzing ahead of Luka Modric and Toni Kroos and behind Karim Benzema. If Zidane can cajole Gareth Bale back into the core, Real Madrid could become unstoppable. Loyalties and enmities aside, this could be a dream team.
In the Modric-Kroos-Casemiro midfield axis, Real have the engine room that could keep Messi and Hazard busy. Messi taking up more playmaking duties can enable Hazard to play more upfront like he did with Chelsea. Zidane would also be one of the few coaches who could manage Messi without getting overwhelmed by his aura.
But still, Bayern would suit Messi better.
LEEDS UNITED: School for romantics
Messi reportedly wanted Marcelo Biesla at Barcelona. He could still play under the manager he deeply reveres. It could be the most challenging chapter of his career to take a newly promoted team to a spot of respectability. Footballing scripts cant be more romantic, but then there arent bigger idealists around than Messi and Bielsa.
The latter is something of a cult hero for most Argentines and European managers, with the reputation for maximising the limited potential of a squad without diluting the games aesthetics. Messi could end up as the greatest ever in the history of the fallen-and-now-risen club. If a street was named after Bielsa after the club was promoted to the Premier League after 14 years, Messi could end up getting a whole township in his name.
Bielsas most aggressive permutation is a flexible, fluid 4-3-3 with pacey wingers who are able to adapt to a 3-4-3 seamlessly, a formation he employed at Messis childhood club, Newell’s Old Boys. And Messi could be the force driving Bielsa’s vehicle of idealism.

JUVENTUS: Feast of the GOATS
Can two contemporary greats, adversaries once upon a time in Spain, their admirers perpetually feuding, function organically for the same team? Will ego take precedence?
Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo together will be the equivalent of Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer turning up for a doubles match. But why not? They are fundamentally two different players with different perceptions and philosophies, with varied skill sets and personalities, but driven by the same indefatigable love of the game and hunger to accumulate trophies and awards.
Messi and Ronaldo could be the most versatile pairing since Alfredo Di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas for Real Madrid. Andrea Pirlo, the new manager and a legendary midfielder himself, could assemble his team in whichever way he fancies: Messi and Ronaldo as the forward duo, or Ronaldo as the central striker and Messi just behind him as the No. 10, or Messi as the attacking tip of a diamond midfield or a deep-lying forward in front of Ronaldo and Dybala.
The interchangeability of their roles will drive defenders into insanity. It could turn out to be the most competitive phase of their respective careers as well. What better way to settle the GOAT debate!
However, it would still be the second best option after Bayern.

The full-service carrier is scheduled to operate special thrice-weekly flights from August 28 to October 24 between the two cities, it said in a statement.
These special flights are being operated under a bilateral 'air bubble' pact signed between India and the UK amid the coronavirus-related travel restrictions.
The flight on Friday departed from Delhi at 2.15 am and landed in London at 6.55 am (local time).
Vistara said on August 18 that it was seeking necessary regulatory approvals to operate similar special flights to Paris in France and Frankfurt in Germany.
The airline has a fleet of 43 aircraft, including 34 Airbus A320s, one Airbus A321neo, six Boeing 737-800NGs and two Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft.
While it received its first Dreamliner aircraft in February, the second one was received earlier this month.
Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, special international flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission and various bilateral air bubble pacts.
Since July, India has established such air bubbles with countries like the US, the UK, France, Germany, the UAE, Qatar and the Maldives. India is negotiating with 13 other countries to establish similar bubbles.

5315028,0,0,View From New York: The Future is what it is!,Matsuyama grabs first-round lead on tough day at Olympia Fields - Reuters,"As the US goes through back-to-back Convention weeks by both the political parties in August, the focus continues to be on the impact of the Covid -19 crisis with unemployment now settling down to still 10 million-plus out of work, though this has come down significantly from 40 million in the initial stages in April.
Depending upon which channel one watches in the US you can either be very optimistic about the current state of affairs or very pessimistic.
While the politics will continue until the November elections, there was due cause for celebration this week with Apple crossing the $2 trillion market-cap, a historic first for any publicly-traded company in the world and recognition of the fact that Tim Cook has surpassed expectations beyond the wildest imagination of any investor on Wall Street.
The one common denominator that seems to be applicable to India and to the US is the utter disbelief by most investors about the disconnect between the rise in the stock market and the unfortunate reality of the economy that we are grappling with.
Adding more misery to this is the spread of riots, high crime and protests in many cities across the US that law enforcement is struggling to cope with.
It seems that people have momentarily forgotten that the US is a nation of immigrants that is a cocoon of inspiration for all around the world and right now that seems to be taking a back seat. but I am sure not for long.
We are clearly in the midst of a global crisis and by that I dont mean the Covid-19 crisis, as I am optimistic the human race has the capability to come up with a vaccine or an antibody sooner rather than later and this is a good test of our resilience as a race.
While the world is working on developing a vaccine or an antibody solution a Parsi from Pune, India is toiling to be the prodigal White Knight planning to ride on his horse just as John Wayne did more than century back to bring joy to the all by working to effectively manufacture the worlds first mass vaccine to save lives.
Though the view from New York is that Indias first quarter GDP may be worse than expected, as the stock market has never seen earnings that have been so low in more than 30 years if not more, the index continues to hover at a record of over 30 times PE.
In the midst of all this doom and gloom, there are rays of shining light such as the turnaround of Yes Bank that was backed by the government and is seen to be a good example of how the government can step in during times of crisis with the right mix of home grown leadership and vision to bring stability to a bank that was on the verge of collapsing and taking many other institutions along with it.
For those looking to invest for a brighter future in India, a global allocation strategy is almost a necessity with a credit squeeze affecting businesses in India and a lower growth on the horizon.
At the cost of sounding gloomy about the future, the bigger risk may be a making of our own again and our ability to create a scenario akin to the War of the Worlds. By that I mean both the first world and the third world with the US and China and China and India, China and Japan, China and Europe and so on
The reality is that peace seems to be a distant dream for the world thus leading to economic wars followed by more debilitating scenarios that no one can afford in the future. If we dont prepare for this today it will be at our own cost in the future.
After all the future will be what it is!!!","(Reuters) - Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama drilled a 67-foot birdie putt on his last hole to grab a one stroke lead at the BMW Championship on Thursday, a day when only three players managed to break par. 
Matsuyama’s three-under 67 put him one clear of American Tyler Duncan and two ahead of Canada’s Mackenzie Hughes as players struggled with fast and firm conditions at Olympia Fields Country Club outside Chicago. 
“Greens were firm and playing really tough,” Matsuyama said. 
“There’s some water holes that you’ve got to avoid, but all in all, I played good and was able to stay out of trouble.” 
Trouble is exactly where many players found themselves in the second of three FedExCup Playoffs events, where they are battling it out for a place in next week’s Tour Championship. 
Dustin Johnson, fresh off an 11-shot win in the Playoffs opener and leading the season-long standings, hit just six fairways but still managed a one-over 71. 
“I’m happy with the score. I’m right there,” said the two-time BMW champion. 
“If I can get my bad round out of the way today and play three solid ones the next couple days, I’ll be all right.” 
Justin Thomas, second in the FedExCup standings, and 15-time major champion Tiger Woods, who needs a strong finish to make next week’s tournament, both finished with three straight bogeys for matching three-over 73s. 
Asked whether any thought was put into not playing the round after some sports halted play this week to protest racial injustice, Woods said the decision was made to go ahead. 
“I talked to the commissioner and they were on board,” he said. 
“So no, obviously there was talk about it because of obviously what happened, but we’re all on board, on the same page.” 
On Thursday the Tour said it would support any players who decide to protest in the wake of the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin on Sunday.

181231,0,0,Mets rally to stun Yankees with trio of homers - Reuters.com,"West Bengal: Pvt hospitals’ body meets panel, talks bed charges, drug discount","Dominic Smith hit a go-ahead solo homer as the New York Mets homered three times in a span of five batters in the sixth inning to beat the New York Yankees 6-4 Friday in the first game of a doubleheader at Yankee Stadium. 
Pete Alonso and Jake Marisnick also homered off Chad Green (2-2) as the Mets opened the five-game series by erasing a four-run deficit. 
Alonso forged a 4-4 tie by snapping a 0-for-13 skid when he hammered Green’s full-count fastball onto the netting above Monument Park in center field for his sixth homer, a three-run blast. 
Three batters later Smith gave the Mets a 5-4 lead when he lined Green’s 0-2 fastball into the Yankee bullpen beyond the center field fence for his team-leading seventh homer. 
Smith’s homer came after an emotional postgame interview following Wednesday’s game against the Miami Marlins. Smith cried when discussing the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. The Mets did not play Thursday after taking the field and participating in a 42-second moment of silence in honor of Jackie Robinson, whom baseball honored Friday. 
Marisnick made it 6-4 when he lifted Green’s 0-2 fastball into the left-field seats for his first homer as a Met. 
Smith also scored the Mets’ first run on a wild pitch by Yankees left-hander Jordan Montgomery in the fifth. 
The Yankees lost their sixth straight, their longest skid since losing seven straight in June 2017. 
Clint Frazier homered and drove in three runs while Luke Voit had three hits in his first three at-bats out of the leadoff spot. Frazier hit an RBI double two batters in, hit a two-run homer in the third, and also scored on a wild pitch by Michael Wacha in the first. 
Montgomery allowed three runs (two earned) on six hits in five-plus innings. He struck out six, walked none and exited after allowing consecutive singles to J.D. Davis and Michael Conforto to start the sixth. 
Wacha returned from missing three weeks with right shoulder inflammation and allowed four runs on six hits in three innings. Wacha struck out seven, walked one and threw 67 pitches. 
Walker Lockett (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings and former Yankee Dellin Betances stranded two in the sixth. Edwin Diaz struck out the side in the seventh and converted his second save in five chances. 
Field Level Media","Both Justice Ashim Kumar Banerjee and the AHEI members agree that this is a battle we need to fight together and we pledged our total support to the commission and the state government. (Representational)A delegation of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI), representing a number of private hospitals in West Bengal, met the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) on Friday to discuss the panels August 22 advisory asking private medical facilities to revert to bed charges that were applicable on March 1. The panel had also requested the hospitals to offer patients a 10 per cent discount on medicines and 20 per cent discount on consumables.
The advisory was issued following complaints of some hospitals overcharging Covid-19 patients. But most private hospitals affiliated to the AHEI have expressed strong reservations about the advisory, saying it will place financial constraints on them.
We had a fruitful meeting with Justice Ashim Kumar Banerjee, chairman of the WBCERC, on Friday. Since this was the first meeting, we presented our concerns to him and he gave us a patient hearing. He clarified that the discount on medicines and consumables are only for cash patients. He also assured us that he will look into the prices of some of the medicines, which are not easily available or have a high demand. In regards to bed charges, which a recent advisory asked us to price as per the rate of March 1, 2020, he urged us to continue with it till December 31, after which the commission will reconsider. Both Justice Banerjee and the AHEI members agree that this is a battle we need to fight together and we pledged our total support to the commission and the state government. We also agreed to meet more in the future, said AHEI president and AMRI Hospitals Group CEO Rupak Barua.
Justice (retired) Banerjee said, In the meeting, they basically focussed on two points one is bed charge. Their financial year starts from April, so they had revised bed charges in April. We suggested that they wait for sometime, and we will think about it. The second challenge they have is to give discounts on medicines, which we clarified is not applicable to corporate or insurance clients.
Meanwhile, the regulatory body said it had asked the South 24 Parganas District Magistrate to initiate an inquiry into a private hospital after a Covid-19 patients family accused it of refusing to share his medical report and demanding Rs 1 lakh to keep it a secret. The medical facility has been identified as Jagannath Gupta Hospital.
The hospital allegedly demanded Rs 1 lakh for keeping a Covid-positive report a secret, and assured treatment. We have asked the District Magistrate of South 24 Parganas to conduct an enquiry locally, Justice Banerjee said in a webinar.
According to the regulatory body, in the last week of July the son of a 68-year-old patient took his father to the hospital after he developed Covid-19 symptoms. The hospital allegedly confirmed that the patient was Covid-positive, but refused to share the report. It then demanded Rs 1 lakh for treatment, and assured the family it would be kept a secret.
The family refused the offer as they are covered under the state health scheme, and took the 68-year-old to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.

398493,0,0,Liam Payne engaged to girlfriend Maya Henry,"'Who is standing up for us?'- Black, rural students left behind as U.S. schools go online - Reuters","English singer and songwriter Liam Payne is engaged to girlfriend and model Maya Henry, according to a source.
According to a report, the 26-year-old singer and Henry were spotted on Thursday evening (local time) in London where the model was snapped sporting a massive diamond ring.
The Texas native paired the blingy rock with a plunging black dress, leather jacket, black handbag and strappy sandal heels while Payne accompanied his fiancee in a gold patterned shirt and black pants.
Payne and Henry were first romantically linked in August 2018, following his split from ex-girlfriend Cheryl in July. However, the former One Direction singer didn't confirm his new romance until September 2019.
After going public, Payne opened up about the couple's decision to embrace the spotlight in a 2019 interview with Roman Kemp. 
At the time, the 'Strip That Down' singer said, ""I'm just past the point of where I'm bothered or not. It's not worth my happiness; I'd just rather go out and do what I want.""I've got nothing to hide.""
Henry also made the romance Instagram official in September with a sweet cuddly photo of the pair which she captioned, ""All smiles over here.""
Payne shares 3-year-old son, Bear Grey, with Cheryl. The English singer and the former boy band musician- who first began dating in late 2015 - announced their split on Twitter in July 2018 in a statement saying they were ""sad"" to part ways and that it was a ""tough decision.""
In October, Payne opened up about how his split from Cheryl and his new relationship with Henry were big moments for his personal growth.
""With love, I think you don't really understand it until it gives you that sting. It took a long time with me. Something really hurt me and it kind of made me appreciate love and people a lot more,"" he said. ""For the longest time, living such an exposed life made dating really hard.""
""And I think it's just the pressure sometimes that you and that person can put on yourselves,"" Payne added. ""I'm kind of at the place in my life now where I just realized it's not worth sacrificing my happiness because somebody might see something.""","WASHINGTON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With coronavirus sweeping through their rural district, the children of Francis Marion School in Perry County, Alabama, started school online this week. But for many, logging on for class was out of the question. 
Only about half of the school’s 600-odd students have reliable internet at home and one in five has no connection at all, said principal Cathy Trimble. 
“Our district cannot afford to get devices for our students. And then the biggest thing is connectivity. No broadband,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 
Perry County is one of the poorest in the state, and Francis Marion School ranks near the bottom of Alabama schools on test scores. Ninety-nine percent of its students are Black. 
As the pandemic forces schools across the country to switch to virtual learning, a technology gap that has existed for decades has suddenly become visible and of urgent concern. 
Some 16 million children, or 30% of all U.S. public school students, lack either an internet connection or a device at home adequate for distance learning, according to a recent study by Boston Consulting Group. 
One in three Black, Latino and Native American students lacks a broadband connection, compared to one in five white students, according to an analysis by four educational advocacy groups in July. 
While donors, states and phone companies have stepped up with plans to connect more students for free or at discounted rates during the pandemic, the programs are temporary and do not reach everyone, educators and analysts said. 
“There’s no big federal imperative or mandate to ensure that every school kid has access to technology,” said Nicol Turner Lee, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think-tank. 
“I think what schools are doing in the interim... is a critical move. But it in no way addresses the Herculean effort that is going to be needed to cover all of America,” she said. 
Before the pandemic, most schools did not know how many of their students lacked home internet. Since then they have scrambled to connect as many as possible, but devices are backordered, funding is limited and time is running out. 
On the Friday before classes were due to start, Trimble had fewer than 100 hotspots for an estimated 300 children who might need one, she said. Some parents had already returned them because they were not picking up a signal where they lived. 
‘BROADBAND DESERT’ 
At least 18 million Americans, or 6% of the population, live in areas where fixed broadband service is not available, according to the Federal Communications Commission. 
Many more have access to the internet, but cannot afford to pay for it. 
In Marion County, South Carolina, both poverty and a lack of coverage keep more than half the population offline, said Miko Pickett, a former IT professional who runs a local foundation called Neighbors Helping Neighbors. 
“We are a broadband desert,” she said. 
The majority of Marion County’s residents are Black, and a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line, according to U.S. Census data. 
When students were first sent home in March, residents and local charities rushed to find solutions. 
“I was on LinkedIn and everything, begging people for laptops. It was horrible,” said Pickett, who shared her own Wi-Fi hotspot with neighbors so their children could do homework. 
South Carolina has earmarked $50 million from its federal coronavirus relief funds to expand internet access, and Marion County schools are expecting laptops and hotspots to arrive next month. 
But students will be playing catch-up to those who transitioned seamlessly to digital learning earlier this year, said Pickett. 
“We’re worried that for children who were already far behind, they will be farther behind,” said Phyllis Martin, CEO of the Tri-County Cradle to Career Collaborative (TCCC), which works to boost educational equity in South Carolina. 
In the three counties where TCCC works, the racial gaps in educational attainment are already vast. 
In 2018, just 20% of Black students attained the expected level of reading by 8th grade, compared to 60% of white students. Lack of technology could widen that gap, Martin said. 
‘NOT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD’ 
Farther south, in Beaufort County, retired bookstore owner Esther Shaver-Harnett, 79, bought 100 hotspots for school children in her community because no one else was doing it. 
“I’ve started raising hell, not money yet,” she said of her quest to get poor students in coastal South Carolina online. 
Beaufort County includes islands such as Hilton Head that are vacation spots for the wealthy, but also has poor, largely Black areas that community members say have been overlooked. 
Educators and advocates say that if anything good comes from the pandemic, it will be shining a light on wide disparities in internet access and getting the issue on legislators’ agendas. 
“The biggest thing that’s happened for our country is to realize that there is a gap,” said Mark Chauhan, technology services officer for the Beaufort County School District. 
Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have petitioned for the right to use coronavirus relief funding to expand permanent broadband infrastructure in rural areas, rather than spending it on short-term solutions such as mobile hotspots. 
The CARES Act - the $2 trillion economic stimulus package signed into law by President Donald Trump in March - stipulates that the money be spent on broadband projects that will be finished by December, effectively limiting it to quick fixes. 
For Trimble, the principal in Perry County, Alabama, time is of the essence. 
“Who is standing up for us?” said Trimble, who spent all summer trying to get broken iPads that had been donated five years ago in working condition for her students. 
“We’re not on a level playing field. We want to at least be in the game.”

Daily Aftonbladet said that around 80 demonstrators had gathered on each of the bridges. 
A third demonstration took place outside an office building in the west of the city. 
“Overall, in all these three places, there has been no violence at all,” a police spokesman said, adding that some demonstrators had been physically removed from the two bridges. 
Representatives from Extinction Rebellion said they were protesting against politicians’ failure to deal with global warming and called on the government to declare a climate emergency. 
“We have had enough of broken promises and fine words,” the group said in a statement published in Aftonbladet. 
“We demand that the government speak clearly, declare a climate emergency and together with other actors communicate the urgency with which we need change. We have to cut emissions, it is as simple as that.” 
The government has a target of being the first fossil free developed economy with zero net emissions by 2045 at the latest.

TARO ASO
Finance minister Aso, 79, who also doubles as deputy prime minister, has been a core member of Abes administration. Without a clear consensus on who should succeed Abe, LDP lawmakers could elect Aso as a temporary leader if Abe resigns.
In 2008, Aso was elected LDP leader and hence, premier, in hopes that he could revive the long-dominant partys fortunes. Instead, the LDP was ousted in a historic election defeat in 2009, languishing in the opposition for the next three years.
The grandson of a former premier, Aso mixes policy experience with a fondness for manga comics and a tendency towards gaffes.
SHIGERU ISHIBA
A hawkish former defence minister and rare LDP critic of Abe, Ishiba, 63, regularly tops surveys of lawmakers whom voters want to see as the next premier, but is less popular with the partys lawmakers.
The soft-spoken security maven has also held portfolios for agriculture and reviving local economies.
He defeated Abe in the first round of a party presidential election in 2012, thanks to strong grassroots support, but lost in the second round when only MPs could vote. Then, in a 2018 party leadership poll, Ishiba lost heavily to Abe.
He has criticised the Bank of Japans ultra-low interest rates for hurting regional banks and called for higher public works spending to remedy growing inequality.
FUMIO KISHIDA
Kishida, 63, served as foreign minister under Abe from 2012 to 2017, but diplomacy remained mainly in the prime ministers grip.
The low-key lawmaker from Hiroshima has been widely seen as Abes preferred successor but ranks low in voter surveys.
Kishida hails from one of the partys more dovish factions and is seen as less keen on revising the post-war constitutions pacifist Article 9 than Abe, for whom it is a cherished goal.
The BOJs hyper-easy monetary policy cannot go on forever, Kishida has said.
TARO KONO
Defence Minister Taro Kono, 56, has a reputation as a maverick but has toed the line on key Abe policies, including a stern stance in a feud with South Korea over wartime history.
Educated at Georgetown University and a fluent English speaker, he previously served as foreign minister and minister for administrative reform.
He has differentiated his conservative stances from those of his father, former chief cabinet secretary Yohei Kono, who authored a landmark 1993 apology to comfort women, a euphemism for women forced to work in Japans wartime military brothels.
YOSHIHIDE SUGA
Suga, 71, a self-made politician and loyal lieutenant since Abes troubled term as premier in 2006 and 2007, was among a band of allies who pushed Abe to run again for the top post in 2012.
Back in office, Abe tapped Suga as chief cabinet secretary, acting as top government spokesman, coordinating policies and keeping bureaucrats in line.
Talk of Suga as a contender bubbled up in April 2019 after he unveiled the new imperial era name, Reiwa, for use on Japanese calendars after the enthronement of the new emperor.
Sugas clout was dented somewhat by scandals that toppled two cabinet ministers close to him last October.
SHINJIRO KOIZUMI
The name of Koizumi, 39, now environment minister and the son of charismatic former premier Junichiro Koizumi, is often floated as a future premier, but many consider him too young.
He shares some of Abes conservative views and has paid his respects at Tokyos controversial Yasukuni Shrine for war dead.
Koizumi has projected a reforming image on the basis of efforts to cut Japans backing for coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, but has typically taken care not to offend party elders.
KATSUNOBU KATO, YASUTOSHI NISHIMURA
As health minister, Kato, 64, was in the limelight in the early days of Japans coronavirus outbreak but then Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, 57, a former trade official, emerged as point person on virus policy.
In 2015, Kato, a father of four, was handed the portfolio for boosting Japans rock-bottom birth rate, a task that met little success. He is a former official of the finance ministry.
SEIKO NODA
Noda, 59, has made no secret of her desire to become Japans first female premier. An Abe critic, the former internal affairs minister, who also held the portfolio for womens empowerment, fell short of backing to join the race for party leader in 2018

For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App.","US President Donald Trump castigated his Democratic rival Joe Biden as ""the destroyer of American greatness"" and assured voters that he will end the raging coronavirus pandemic that has ravaged the economy and quell the civil unrest, as he accepted the Republican nomination for a second term in office.
""This election will decide whether we save the American dream"" or whether ""we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny,"" Trump, 74, said on Thursday amidst cheers from some 1,500 ardent supporters who were mostly maskless.
My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States,"" he said in his 70-minute address from the South Lawn of the White House as hundreds of protesters staged a noisy demonstration outside against his policies.
I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years, Trump said.
In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity! he said.
""We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before,"" he told the Americans as the country has witnessed over 180,000 deaths and over five million COVID-19 infections, making the the US the worst-hit nation.
Party's delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Trump and Pence are being challenged in the November 3 elections by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris.
Trump slammed Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness.
""He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness.""
Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history, Trump said.
The president said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered.
This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas, he said.
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens.
And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it, he said.
""Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism,"" he said.
Trump also referred to violent racial justice protests that have swept the nation in recent months following the killings of Black Americans.
The president said the Democrats at their party convention last week had disparaged America as a place of racial, social and economic injustice.
""So tonight I ask you a very simple question - how can the Democrat party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?
""In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins,"" Trump said.
Attacking his opponent's decades-long political life, Trump said: ""Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars.""
China, Trump said, would ""own our country"" if Biden wins and that only he would hold Beijing accountable for the ""tragedy they caused"" over the COVID-19.
Meanwhile, in an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump's acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party.
Earlier, Trump was introduced by one of his daughters, Ivanka, who said her father did not come to Washington to win praise from the Beltway elites, but to ""make America great again"".
""Washington has not changed Donald Trump.Donald Trump has changed Washington,"" she said.
Biden's running mate, Harris, delivered a speech hours before the president spoke, declaring: ""Donald Trump doesn't understand the presidency.""
""Donald Trump has failed at the most basic and important job of a president of the United States: he failed to protect the American people, plain and simple,"" the Indian-American senator said.

676770,0,0,Cases per lakh population: Jalandhar tally is more than double of Ludhiana,6 ministers of Oppn-ruled states move SC seeking review of NEET-JEE order,"Written by Navjeevan Gopal
 | Chandigarh | 
Published: August 29, 2020 2:33:55 am
As of August 26, the cases of infection per lakh population in Jalandhar district were more than double of those in Ludhiana. There were 5,817 cases in Jalandhar and 10,147 in Ludhiana. (Representational)Ludhiana may be the district with maximum number of Covid-19 cases in Punjab, but in terms of severity of the pandemic, Jalandhar has emerged as a hotbed of infections, going by the positive cases per lakh population, an analysis of official data has shown.
As of August 26, the cases of infection per lakh population in Jalandhar district were more than double of those in Ludhiana. There were 5,817 cases in Jalandhar and 10,147 in Ludhiana. While Ludhiana had 407.4 cases for every one lakh people, Jalandhar had 976.8 cases.
After Jalandhar, Amritsar, with total positive caseload of 3,612, had the second highest per lakh population cases (584.9).
While 1.37 lakh samples were collected in Ludhiana, in Jalandhar, 74,405 samples were taken, according to the Punjab Covid-19 Status Report till August 26. In Amritsar, a cumulative 77,240 samples were taken for testing.
More testing in Ludhiana explains the maximum total caseload from any district in the state so far, said an official.
Need to increase testing
A government functionary said there was a need to increase testing in other districts also, particularly Jalandhar and Patiala which were witnessing higher cases per lakh population.
The functionary, interestingly, added that there was more testing in Ludhiana because the district had “more tertiary care facilities than other districts”.
The functionary also said that more testing meant lesser fatalities as it helps in early treatment and patient management, a claim which official statistics belie, with highest testing district Ludhiana reporting the highest Covid-19 death toll (363), more than double the fatalities in Amritsar (149) and Ludhiana (148).
Sampling to be doubled in these districts
Punjab Health and Family Welfare Principal Secretary Hussan Lal said, “We are increasing testing in Patiala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar. We have 35 mobile medical units across the state. We are redeploying these units, focusing on these four districts. We are planning to double the sampling in these districts and on Saturday we are having a meeting with field officers. Officials of these districts would be asked if there is any issue in doubling the testing.”
On difference in scale of sampling in districts, especially relatively lesser sampling taking place in districts with higher cases per lakh population, Lal said, “It depends upon how much sampling is taking place and in which particular area. If you have distributed your teams equally in urban and rural areas, then the number of samples would be less. If you push more teams into urban areas, the sampling numbers would be higher since such urban areas are thickly populated.”
As of August 26, as per the Punjab Covid-19 Status Report, a cumulative of 1,37,501 samples were taken in Ludhiana, 77,240 in Amritsar, 74,277 in Patiala, 74,405 in Jalandhar, 62,975 in Gurdaspur district and 52,114 in Hoshiarpur district. In the remaining 16 districts, less than 50,000 samples were taken. And out of those 16 districts, less than 25,000 samples taken with Muktsar district at the bottom with 20,807 cumulative samples taken so far. Muktsar is among the districts where cases have doubled at a faster pace recently. As of Thursday (August 27), the doubling rate of cases in Muktsar was 15 days, as compared to 20 days on August 13.
An official spokesperson of Punjab government on Friday said, “At present, the state government has capacity to conduct 24,000 tests per day and the target is to achieve the milestone of 30,000 tests by next week.
In terms of tests per million of population, as of August 26, Punjab had conducted 31,647 tests per million population, higher than the national average of 28,639, but lesser than seven other states, including neighbouring Haryana (35,148 tests per million of population).

For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App.","Six ministers of opposition ruled states -- West Bengal, Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand -- have jointly filed a review petition in the Supreme Court challenging its August 17 order declining to entertain pleas seeking postponement of NEET-JEE exams slated in September in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic.
The petition has been filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes and it contends the top court's order to ""secure the safety, security and right to life of the students -- candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE exams.""
The petition argues that the top court has ignored the teething logistical difficulties in conducting the examinations at the proposed dates.
""Failed to balance the competing but equally important aspects of conducting the examination and securing safety of the student. Fails to ensure that mandatory safeguards are put in place during the conducting of the examinations,"" said the petition challenging the August 17 order.
""The advice of 'Life Must Go On' may have sounded very philosophical underpinnings but cannot be a substitute for valid legal reasoning and logical analysis of the various aspects involved in the conduct of the NEET (UG) and JEE exams,"" argued the petitioners.
The petitioners said the apex court failed to appreciate that the Centre had adequate time to establish at least one centre for every district for NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) rather than having several centres in one district.
""Having at least one centre per district would have minimised the inter-district long travel of the students and thereby reduced the chances of Covid-19 spread,"" argued the petitioners.
The petitioners contended that if the August 17 order is not reviewed then grave and irreparable harm and injury would befall on the student community of the country and it will impact health, welfare and safety of the students/candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE examinations.
""With regards to the second reason of losing a year, it is most respectfully submitted that this would be tantamount to putting the cart before the horse, as the submissions hereinabove have revealed.
""The Review Petitioners too do not desire for the students to lose an academic year, but wish to balance their health, safety and security and that of their family with not losing the current academic year,"" said the petition.
The Petitioner number one is Moloy Ghatak -- Minister-in-Charge, Department of Labour &amp; E.S.I. (MB) Scheme and Departments of Law &amp; Judicial, Government of West Bengal.
Petitioner number two is Dr. Rameshwar Oraon -- Cabinet Minister of Finance, Government of Jharkhand.
Petitioner number three is Dr. Raghu Sharma -- Cabinet Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Rajasthan.
Petitioner number four is Amarjeet Bhagat -- Minister of Food, Civil supplies, Culture, Planning, Economics &amp; Statistics, Government of Chhattisgarh.
Petitioner number five is Balbir Singh Sidhu -- Cabinet Minister Health and Family Welfare &amp; Labour, Government of Punjab.
Petitioner number six is Uday Ravindra Samant -- Minister of Higher and Technical Education, Government of Maharashtra.

6883935,0,0,Freeport Indonesia workers end protest over COVID-19 lockdown: workers' rep - Reuters,Japan PM Shinzo Abe to address health concerns in press conference,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Workers at PT Freeport Indonesia’s Grasberg gold and copper mine on Friday ended a protest demanding an easing of travel restrictions at the mine due to the coronavirus pandemic, Yonpis Tabuni, a workers’ representative, told Reuters. 
The protest started on Monday with workers blocking access to the mining complex and calling on Freeport to resume a bus service to allow them to travel to a nearby town to meet their families and for a bonus payment. 
A spokesman for the Indonesian unit of Freeport-McMoran Inc late on Thursday said the local government had given permission to ease restrictions. 
Reporting by Agustinus Beo Da Costa; Writing by Fransiska Nangoy; Editing by Ed Davies","TOKYO: Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will address speculation over his health at a press conference later Friday, with reports suggesting he will say he is fit to stay in office.
Questions about Abe's health have been swirling since he made a previously unannounced visit to hospital for medical checks on August 17, and then returned for further checks a week later, on Monday.
Abe, 65, ended his first term as prime minister after just a year in the job, in part due to crippling health problems later diagnosed as ulcerative colitis.
Even before the recent hospital visits, there had been reports claiming the prime minister was vomiting blood, as well as questions over his limited public appearances and decision to avoid holding a press conference to address criticism of his handling of the coronavirus.
Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga has attempted to dismiss the speculation, repeating Friday that Abe remained in good health.
""In terms of the prime minister's health, the prime minister himself has said he wishes to work hard and I see him every day and feel that there is no change in his condition,"" Suga told reporters at a regular press conference.
On Thursday, Suga told Bloomberg News that Abe would ""of course"" be able to serve out the rest of his term, which lasts until September 2021.
""He'll be all right,"" he said.
Analysts said it now looked likely Abe would seek to stay on through the end of his term as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which ends in September 2021.
""What is clear is that Abe's health is not in good shape,"" Mikitaka Masuyama, a professor of politics at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, told AFP.
""But I think he will stay in office while managing his illness,"" Masuyama said, noting that Japan has been able to keep its coronavirus outbreak relatively contained and Abe retains reasonable public support.
""Even though public support has fallen sharply, levels above 30 percent are not bad for a Japanese prime minister,"" he said.
Abe's health woes come at a bad time for the prime minister, who this week broke the record for the longest uninterrupted stint in office in Japanese history.
Despite the relatively contained impact of coronavirus in Japan, Abe's government has been heavily criticised for its approach to the crisis, including a U-turn on stimulus payments and a much-mocked decision to issue each household two cloth face masks.
The prime minister has also seen his signature ""Abenomics"" economic policy come under increasing strain, with the country already slumping into recession even before the coronavirus crisis hit.
Still, experts say there is little appetite within the LDP for Abe to depart early, especially as there is no consensus yet on his successor.
And with Japan's fragmented opposition so far unable to capitalise on the government's falling approval ratings, there is little pressure on Abe to step aside.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-freeport-mcmoran-idUSKBN25O0HG,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/japan-pm-shinzo-abe-to-address-health-concerns-in-press-conference/articleshow/77796350.cms

President Donald Trump accepts the Republican presidential nomination during the final night of the Republican National Convention, on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, on Thursday. (Doug Mills/The New York Times)US President Donald Trump has officially accepted the re-nomination of the Republican Party as its presidential candidate for the November elections, telling his fellow Americans that at no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas.
Trump, 74, in his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House amidst cheers from his supporters on Thursday night, said: “My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States.”
“I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years,” Trump said.
“In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history” quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity!? he said.
Party’s delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
Pence delivered his acceptance speech from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday. This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Addressing an audience of about 1,500 invited guests, Trump said that the Republican Party goes forward united, determined and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
Trump and Pence are being challenged by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin senator Kamala Harris.
Harris, 55, has scripted history by becoming the first African-American and Indian-origin person to be nominated as a vice presidential candidate by a major political party.
As per an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days from now is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump’s acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party, which gathers once in four years in one of the American cities to nominate its presidential candidate.
This year it was scheduled to be held in Charlotte in North Carolina. Due to the restrictions on social gatherings as a result of the coronaviruspandemic, the convention went into a virtual mode, with only essential official business being held in Charlotte.
Popular Indian-American politician Nikki Haley was the star speaker on Monday, the first day. First Lady Melania Trump addressed the convention from Rose Garden of the White House on Tuesday, while Pence delivered his acceptance speech on Wednesday.
Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who is also his presidential advisor, addressed the convention before him on Thursday night.
“He’s our commander-in-chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. He is our president, and my father, Donald J Trump,” Ivanka said.
His son Donald Trump Jr addressed the convention on Monday, while daughter Tiffney and other son Eric addressed the convention on Tuesday and daughter-in-law Lara on Wednesday. A group of protesters had gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House in advance of Trump’s speech.
Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, and his wife were among the special invitees on the South Lawns of the White House for Trump’s acceptance speech. Al Mason said it was amazing spectacular and full of enthusiasm never seen in the Democratic convention last week.

For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App.","NEw Delhi/Mumbai: Inadequate collateral and weak cash flows are likely to be key challenges for airlines seeking one-time loan restructuring after the loan moratorium ends on 31 August, bankers and airline executives said.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has appointed a five-member panel led by former ICICI Bank chief executive K.V. Kamath to prepare a report by 6 September on the criteria to recast covid-19 related stressed accounts. Airlines remain engaged with lenders, but a final decision can be taken only after the committees recommendations.
Airlines are in desperate need for working capital, but bankers are not very keen to fund the recovery of the sector.
Banks want promoters of these companies to bring in fresh equity,"" said an airline industry executive. However, given that the aviation sector may take longer than the other sectors to fully revive, most companies may find it difficult to raise fresh equity in the tough market,"" he said requesting anonymity.
InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs Indias largest airline IndiGo, on 10 August said it will raise up to 4,000 crore ($533.70 million) by selling shares to institutional investors. However, with air travel expected to remain muted for an extended period, most airlines are banking on funds from promoters.
Airlines today follow the asset-light approach to trim costs and thus have minimal assets that can be kept as collateral to raise money from lenders,"" said a second person, a senior executive with a low-fare airline. Banks are hesitant to lend to a stressed sector, especially after closure of airlines such as Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines, which owed huge amounts to them. This creates a liquidity problem, especially during a crisis like this,"" he said.
Indian airlines are expected to report consolidated losses of $6.0-6.5 billion in FY2021 and an estimated $4.5-5 billion of funding will be required to overcome this crisis, aviation consultancy firm Capa India said in a recent report.
Based on our continuous research and monitoring of the industry since the covid crisis took hold, we have come to the conclusion that no individual stakeholder, whether a promoter, a bank, a private equity fund or the government, is willing to make the first move to fund the recovery of an operator,"" the report said.
Their fear is that if they act alone and others do not play their part, recovery may remain elusive and it will be a case of throwing good money after bad,"" it said.
Aviation is one of the sectors that needs immediate relief and that can be possible only through the new debt recast window. Moreover, unless the leverage ratio is decided by the Kamath committee, bank boards are only framing detailed policies for retail assets and are largely following RBIs pointers on stressed corporate loans,"" a top official with a public sector bank said under condition of anonymity.
Lenders are unsure if airlines can service debt even if repayment periods are stretched by two years, said a second lender.
Moreover, we will have to convert some of the debt into equity or zero-coupon bonds because it would not make sense to simply elongate the repayment deadline. Banks will have to take a haircut in the process,"" said the second banker.
Meanwhile, Capa India said airline and airport promoters will need to present well-thought out recapitalization plans to fully fund their companies through FY2021 and FY2022 to emerge from the ongoing crisis.
A positive outcome will only be achieved if all stakeholders (promoters, the government, and lenders) work in concert with each other and if financing is accompanied by structural reforms at a company and at an industry level,"" it said.

7293257,0,0,"Can you get a flu shot now? yes, and doctors say you should",Young Hong Kong democracy protester says he was beaten by prison guards - Reuters,"Everyone above the age of 6 months should be getting the flu vaccine, said Dr. Uchenna Ikediobi, an assistant professor of general internal medicine and infectious diseases at Yale University. (AP/File)Written by Concepción de León
People usually dont think about flu shots until the fall, so you might be surprised to learn that many places are already offering them. Public health officials, fearing that the confluence of COVID-19 and influenza cases could result in a twindemic that will further overburden hospitals and testing locations, are urging vaccination for nearly everyone.
We dont have many arrows in our quiver in terms of combating COVID, said Dr. Kevin Ban, the chief medical officer for Walgreens, which began administering the vaccine across its stores on Aug. 17. Thats why medical professionals are focusing instead on minimizing flu cases, so resources go where they need to, he added.
Here is everything doctors want you to know about the influenza vaccine this year.
Who should get vaccinated?
Everyone above the age of 6 months should be getting the flu vaccine, said Dr. Uchenna Ikediobi, an assistant professor of general internal medicine and infectious diseases at Yale University.
In particular, those who are at a higher risk should get it, she said. This includes adults over 65, those with underlying illnesses like asthma or heart disease, pregnant women, caretakers who are exposed to vulnerable groups and essential workers, among others.
Growing concern over the combined impact of the two viruses has even led some to mandate the vaccine. The University of California system announced this month that it would require all its employees and students to get a flu shot by Nov. 1. And Massachusetts is requiring all students between 6 months and 30 years old to get the flu shot by the end of the year.
When should I get my flu shot?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that everyone get the flu shot in September or October, before the start of the flu season. Experts suggest that adults over 65 and those with compromised immune systems wait until at least mid-September, so that the vaccines protection lasts the entire season.
But if you are young and healthy, if the flu shot is available in your area, I would suggest to get it, now, said Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, an infectious disease physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
Dr. William Schaffner, the medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said it was better to go early than not at all. And if you miss the recommended time frame, you should still go, since influenza cases typically reach their peak in February. Not every vaccine is a perfect match, and sometimes people still get sick even if they get a shot. But it will make your illness less severe, and make it less likely youll end up in the hospital, Schaffner said.
Are influenza vaccines safe?
Absolutely. Despite unfounded fears, there is no evidence of adverse effects in most people. Some people do experience mild symptoms like a sore arm, itchy eyes or fatigue after getting the flu shot, but these usually go away on their own within a few days.
Even if you are pregnant, you can and should get vaccinated. Pregnant women are one of the groups the CDC says are at high risk for influenza complications.
Vaccines undergo several clinical trials, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the FDA before the medicine is released to the public. The vaccines continue to be monitored for safety and effectiveness, and every year the CDC releases new flu vaccination guidelines.
What if I am allergic to eggs?
Some vaccines are grown using chicken eggs, so some people with egg allergies have avoided getting the shot. Those with mild or moderate egg allergies should still get the shot, Marcelin said. If you have a severe allergy, however, you should consult your doctor, who should supervise the vaccination. There is also an egg-free vaccine available.
If you are pregnant and allergic to eggs, you should consult your doctor about the best vaccine for you.
What if I dont like needles?
Theres a nasal version of the flu vaccine. While past studies have found that method to be most effective for children, that guidance has changed in recent years. The nasal vaccine is now approved for people ages 2 to 49, unless they are pregnant or have certain medical conditions. And you should not get this type of treatment with a runny or congested nose, Marcelin said, because that can interfere with the delivery of the vaccine. The nasal spray is not as widely available Walgreens, for instance, does not carry it but you can request it from your doctor.
Where should I get the vaccine?
Rite Aid, CVS and Walgreens (and its Duane Reade stores in New York) all have the vaccine in stock, as do other pharmacies. To find a location near you, try the Healthmap Vaccine Finder tool. In an effort to expand access, the U.S. Department of Health is also allowing pharmacists to administer the vaccine to young children. Walgreens reduced its age requirement from 7 to 4 years old in eligible states, while CVS pharmacists are administering the shot to kids as young as 3. You may also contact your doctor.
How is the vaccine different this year?
As always, this years shot was updated to include the influenza variants that are predicted to circulate in the United States. But there is a special vaccine for adults 65 and older with a higher dosage that has been updated to protect against four strains of influenza, rather than three as in previous years. A version of that high-dosage shot containing adjuvant, which boosts immune response, was also licensed.
How much does it cost?
For those with private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, the shot is typically free or comes with a low copayment. Contact your insurer for more information.
If you dont have coverage, it may be worth shopping around. At Walgreens, the uninsured cost is $40.99 for the quadrivalent shot, which is the most common variety, and $72.99 for the shot geared toward those 65 and older. At CVS and Rite Aid, it is a little cheaper: $39.99 for the seasonal vaccine, and $69.99 for the high-dose vaccine.
Could we see a repeat of past shortages?
Its too early to know for sure but thats highly unlikely, Ikediobi said. This year, manufacturers project that they will deliver as many as 198 million flu shots, which is at least 15% more than the record number produced last year.
Still, its best not to procrastinate. What Im telling my patients every opportunity that I get is that we do not know what this season is going to look like, Ikediobi said. Find out now where you can get it without hesitation so that when the season starts in the next few weeks, you are in line and youve gotten yours.
What about coronavirus precautions?
The CDC has released safety guidelines for all health care providers. So as long as your provider is following these guidelines, it is safe to get your shot there. For example, Ban said Walgreens has implemented rigorous cleaning protocols and is checking patients for symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Pharmacists who administer the shots wear both a face mask and a face shield, and patients are required to wear a mask.
How serious is the threat of a twindemic?
Medical experts dont know. Some hope that the measures taken against coronavirus could also slow the spread of influenza.
Those precautions should be familiar by now: avoiding large groups, maintaining at least 6 feet of distance from others in public, washing your hands frequently, and wearing masks and other face coverings, especially indoors.
Schaffner said there have been some papers suggesting that very rigorous use of masks, social distancing and indeed the lockdown reduced the transmission of influenza in other countries.
But that may not be the case in the U.S., he warned. There are the real careful people who are being very attentive, he said, and then there are lots of people unfortunately in this country who are being rather careless and carefree.
This inconsistent behavior makes it hard to predict anything about the flu season.
But Ikediobi said that places with a good track record of following coronavirus precautions could have fewer cases of influenza. This is just a prediction.

For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App.","HONG KONG (Reuters) - A 21-year-old man told Reuters he was beaten and humiliated by guards in a Hong Kong prison during his sentence for possessing a Molotov cocktail at an anti-government protest in October. 
Roy Cheung said guards routinely slapped him, hit him with rulers and elbowed his spine at the Pik Uk Correctional Institution in Hong Kong’s New Territories. 
In one instance, on Feb. 7, he said he was targeted for beating because he was one of six prisoners who sang the pro-democracy protest anthem “Glory to Hong Kong.” 
“We sang in the cell,” said Cheung. “We were punished the next day.” Cheung said a guard told him to say thank you as he slapped him once.   
Cheung, who served his eight-month sentence from Nov. 2 to June 30, told Reuters he filed an official complaint about the beatings to the Complaints Investigation Unit of Hong Kong’s Correctional Services Department, which runs the city’s prisons, in May. Reuters did not see a copy of the complaint, which was made while Cheung was in prison, and which Cheung said he was not given a copy of. 
The commissioner replied in a letter dated July 10, seen by Reuters, that the Complaints Investigation Unit was investigating his complaint.  
A representative of the Correctional Services Department declined comment on Cheung’s complaint, saying the department does not comment on individual cases. The person said the department’s Complaints Investigation Unit would conduct a fair, just and detailed investigation of every complaint. 
Cheung told Reuters he wanted to make his complaint public in an effort to prevent mistreatment of other protesters who are still detained at Pik Uk. 
Four other 18 and 19-year-old pro-democracy protesters, who asked to be identified only by their first names Tom, Ivan, Jackson and Henry, described similar abuse as they were held at Pik Uk after courts refused to grant them bail when they were charged with protest-related offences. The four have since been released from Pik Uk and are awaiting trial.  
The men said the prison guards hit them in ways to avoid bruising and scars and in places in the prison where there was no CCTV, such as near staircases outside the activity room or inside bathrooms.  
The Correctional Services Department told Reuters it was investigating the allegations made by the men.  
None of the men has filed an official complaint with the Correctional Services Department, saying they feared retaliation by guards if they have to return to Pik Uk.  
Cheung told Reuters his cell was inspected by guards every day after he filed a complaint and that he was put in solitary confinement for some periods. 
HUMAN RIGHTS COMPLAINT 
In June, pro-democracy organization Demosisto filed a complaint on behalf of Tom, Ivan and Jackson about alleged abuse at the prison with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The United Nations declined to comment. 
According to Demosisto’s complaint, which was made public in June, guards at Pik Uk targeted protest prisoners by slapping them, elbowing them in the spine, and hitting their hands and feet with sticks, rulers and police batons. The Correctional Services Department declined comment on the complaint.  
Joshua Wong, former secretary-general of pro-democracy group Demosisto who was imprisoned in 2017 for his role in Hong Kong’s 2014 ‘Umbrella’ protests, told Reuters he was subjected to demeaning treatment in prison, such as being made to squat naked while being questioned by guards in an area of the prison with no CCTV. 
He made an official complaint to the Correctional Services Department, but an internal investigation by the department concluded last year that his complaint was unfounded on the grounds that there was no evidence. The Correctional Services Department declined to comment on the decision, saying it could not comment on individual cases. 
Demosisto, which called for a referendum to determine Hong Kong’s sovereignty, was disbanded on June 30 as China passed a national security law which makes anything Beijing regards as subversion or promoting independence punishable by life in prison. 
Lam Tsz-wai, senior information officer in the office of Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam, referred Reuters back to the prisons department for comment on the complaints made by Cheung and the other men. 
China’s foreign ministry declined comment. The State Council Information Office and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing also did not reply to a faxed request for comment. 
The 385-person capacity Pik Uk Correctional Institution is used to incarcerate males between the ages of 16 and 21 who are awaiting trial or have been convicted of crimes. 
According to Hong Kong lawmaker Shiu Ka Chun, who has visited Pik Uk regularly over the past year and gathered information from prisoners there, at least 55 male protesters have been held in custody at the prison since June 2019. Of those, he said 22 are still there. The prisons department said it does not have data on the number of people in detention related to the demonstrations.  
Hong Kong police said they have arrested 9,672 people and charged 2,093 people since pro-democracy protests turned violent in June last year. 
In May, the first protester to plead guilty to the charge of rioting during last year’s protests was sentenced to four years in prison. More than 1,600 await trial on charges related to the protests, according to government data.

Picasso's Bust of a Woman, 1944 (left); Tate Modern in London. (Source: tate.org.uk, Wikimedia Commons)A student of architecture, Shakeel Ryan Massey, who punched a £20 million Picasso painting at Tate Modern in December 2019, was sentenced to 18 months in jail earlier this week by a court in London.
Media reports in the UK said Massey used metal padlocks in his hands wrapped in a scarf to smash through protective glass, punched the painting several times, pulled it off the wall, and threw it on the floor. He later claimed he was carrying out an art performance.
He told the court through his lawyer that his actions were nothing more than an attempt to seek notoriety and five minutes of fame.
Titled ‘Bust of a Woman’, the 1944 work depicts Picasso’s well known muse, the photographer Dora Maar. The work is owned by a private collector, and has been loaned to Tate Modern since 2011. Repairs could take up to 18 months and cost up to £350,000.
While art lovers were shocked after the incident, this isn’t the first time that a valuable work of art has been vandalised.
Here are five recent examples the offenders were sometimes spared, on other occasions they were made to pay a penalty or serve a jail sentence.
 ‘Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan on 16 November 1581’. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)Ilya Repin, ‘Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan on November 16, 1581’
One of the most closely watched art vandalism trials was that of the Russian Igor Podporin, who was charged with causing serious damage to Ilya Repins famous late 19th century painting of the grief-stricken Ivan IV Vasilyevich, commonly known as Ivan the Terrible, the first Tsar of Russia (1547-84), cradling his dying son in his arms after having dealt him a mortal blow.
The painting, which was completed in 1885, is considered a Russian cultural treasure.
Podporin, a (then) 37-year-old man from Voronezh in southwestern Russia, was arrested immediately after he struck the painting with a metal pole in May 2018. At a press conference, Russia’s then Deputy Culture Minister Vladimir Aristarkhov said that his Ministry expected the man to receive the most severe punishment possible.
Podporin initially claimed that he had drunk too much vodka before he attacked the painting, but changed his story later to say that he was driven by the fact that the painting was historically inaccurate. The painting is a lie, Podporin told the court, according to a Reuters report from 2018, quoting Russian news agencies. He (Tsar Ivan the Terrible) is ranked among the community of saints, the vandal said.
This version of history has gained traction recently in a certain nationalist narrative of Russia’s Tsarist past. Some Russian historians have submitted that Ivan did not actually murder his son, and President Vladimir Putin himself said in 2017 that it was not clear whether the Tsar was guilty as depicted.
In April 2019, a court in Moscow found Podporin guilty of vandalising the famous Repin, and sentenced him to two and a half years in prison.
 Black on Maroon, 1958. (Source: tate.org.uk)Mark Rothko, ‘Black on Maroon’
In May 2014, a painting by the American abstract expressionist master Mark Rothko was put back on display at Tate Modern after 18 months of restoration work.
The painting, which Rothko finished between 1958 and 1959, and donated to Tate in 1968, was vandalised by a Polish man named Wlodzimierz Umaniec who, on October 7, 2012, painted the words ‘A Potential Piece of Yellowism’ in a corner. He was subsequently reported to have claimed the vandalism was an artistic act, and compared himself to the French-American Marcel Duchamp, an acknowledged pioneer of conceptual art.
A London court jailed Umaniec for two years for vandalising the Rothko, reportedly valued at between £5 and £9 million, and said his actions were entirely deliberate, planned, and intentional.

Leonardo da Vinci, ‘Mona Lisa’
Arguably the world’s most recognised painting has been attacked multiple times. Most recently, a Russian woman who was angry at having been denied French citizenship, threw a coffee mug at the painting in 2009.
The first of the recent attacks on the masterpiece happened in the winter of 1956, when a homeless man named Hugo Unzaga Villegas threw a rock at it, apparently because he wanted to go to prison so he would get a warm bed.
Only a few months previously, acid had been thrown at the lower part of the painting when it was being shown in a museum in Montauban, France.
Then in 1974, a woman with disabilities sprayed the work with red paint while it was on display at the Tokyo National Museum, as she was upset over the lack of disabled access to it.
Cy Twombly, Untitled
In 2007, French-Cambodian artist Rindy Sam was fined after she kissed an all-white painting by the American artist Edwin Parker ‘Cy’ Twombly Jr., leaving a lipstick mark on the canvas.
The untitled canvas, reportedly worth $2.5 million, was on display at Collection Lambert in France.
Sam was reported to have said during a court hearing that she was overcome by passion when she saw the painting. I just gave it a kiss. It was an act of love, when I kissed it, I wasn’t thinking. I thought the artist would understand, she said.
She was ordered to pay 1,000 to the owner, 500 to the gallery, and a symbolic 1 to the artist.
Prior to this, at the Sao Paulo International Biennial in 1996, a painting from Andy Warhol’s 1977 Torsos series, which featured male and female nudes, was kissed by a Brazilian woman. The lipstick mark was removed without much trouble, and the accused was not punished or even publicly identified.

In February 2014, Miami artist Maximo Caminero, then 51, entered the Perez Art Museum, picked up a colour-dipped vase by the Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei, and threw it to the floor. The vase was one of 16 in an installation by Ai titled Coloured Vase.
Charged with criminal mischief, Caminero was reported to have said that he had smashed the artwork for all the local artists in Miami that have never been shown in museums here.
Some voices who defended Caminero and agreed with the criticism that galleries and museums preferred international artists to local ones, pointed out that Ai Weiwei had himself vandalised the valuable ancient artefact by painting it over in whimsical colours.
Caminero was reported to have suggested that he had been inspired by Ai’s celebrated 1995 work ‘Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn’, a series of three black-and-white photos that show Ai with what has been claimed to be a priceless 2,000-year-old vase in his hand, the vase in mid-air as it falls to the floor, and Ai standing impassively over shattered fragments of the vase. The work was on display at the Perez Museum, and the description of the three pictures said Ai had dropped the urn, dated from 206-200 BC, on the floor to express the notion that new ideas and values can be produced through iconoclasm, The New York Times reported at the time.
Be that as it may, Caminero still had to pay the insurers $10,000 restitution.

Friday's convention is expected to be the largest gathering of Black activists and artists, albeit virtual, since the historic 1972 National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana, which concluded with the introduction of a national Black agenda. (AP Photo/Hassene Dridi)Black Lives Matter activists are holding their first Black National Convention Friday, a virtual event that will adopt a political agenda calling for slavery reparations, universal basic income, environmental justice and legislation that entirely re-imagines criminal justice reform.
The gathering follows Democratic and Republican party conventions that laid out starkly different visions for America. It also comes on the heels of yet another shooting by a white police officer of a Black man – 29-year-old Jacob Blake – in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that sparked days of protests, unrest and violence.
And it comes on the same day as a commemoration of the 1963 March on Washington, where the families of an ever-growing list of police and vigilante violence victims will appear with civil rights leaders.
Friday’s live-stream broadcast will include policy proposals on such issues as voter suppression, reproductive rights, inequality in public education, housing insecurity and inter-communal violence, according to its agenda, shared exclusively with The Associated Press.
“These are absolutely public policies that the Democratic Party, state and local officials, or anyone who is looking to serve Black people can take up now”, said Jessica Byrd, who leads the Electoral Justice Project of the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 150 Black groups organizing the event.
In 2016, the coalition released its “Vision for Black Lives” policy platform which included early proposals for defunding police. The new agenda revamps much of that original platform with specific proposals that could lead to an eventual abolition of the criminal justice system as it exists today.
It takes on the pledge Wednesday by Vice President Mike Pence at the Republican National Convention, who defended police and called for an end to unrest in cities where arson, looting and violence have followed peaceful protests over police brutality. “Under President Trump, we will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line”, Pence declared. “And we’re not going to defund the police. Not now, not ever.”
Similar to the Democratic and Republican conventions, much of Friday’s Black Lives gathering will feature pre-taped conversations, performances and other presentations, including 28 mini- documentaries on the issues and addresses by Black organizers in California, Minnesota, Kentucky and Wisconsin.
Earlier this week, yet another flashpoint put police brutality in the national spotlight: The police shooting Sunday in Kenosha that left Blake paralyzed, according to his lawyers. The protests and unrest that followed left two people dead Tuesday.
“Anyone who is watching, who is both enraged or looking for action, will find a space” in the Black National Convention, Byrd said.
The nearly four-hour-long event, livestreaming on the website BlackNovember.org, was directed by award-winning writer and filmmaker dream hampton, who won acclaim last year for the “Surviving R. Kelly” docuseries. Hosts include activist and TV actress Angelica Ross of “Pose” and “American Horror Story” fame, along with Phillip Agnew and Kayla Reed, veterans of the Trayvon Martin protests and Ferguson Uprising, respectively.
“I have long thought there was great storytelling to do in the world of Black activism”, hampton told the AP. “The real stars have always been these organizers who get things done.”
Speakers include Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter Global Network; Tarana Burke, founder of the (hash)MeToo movement; Raquel Willis, a writer and transgender rights activist; and Eddie Glaude, chairman of the Center for African American Studies at Princeton University.
The Black National Convention was originally planned to take place in-person in Detroit, the nation’s Blackest major city. But as the coronaviruspandemic exploded in March, organizers shifted to a virtual event.
Friday’s convention is expected to be the largest gathering of Black activists and artists, albeit virtual, since the historic 1972 National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana, which concluded with the introduction of a national Black agenda.
Earlier in the day on Friday, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III, a son of the late civil rights icon, will hold a commemoration of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Sharpton and King will be joined at the Lincoln Memorial by the families of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and Blake, as well as representatives of the Martin and Eric Garner families.
The Black National Convention broadcast begins after the D.C. march has concluded.
“This is truly for Black people, to sit on our porches, or on the train, or socially distanced in a park, and to be like, ‘Look at us’ “, Byrd said. “There is nothing that we can’t do. And everything good in this country, we’ve been a part of.”

For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App.","Describing Donald Trump as the ""people's president"" and listing out his administration's ""people-friendly"" policies during his first term, his daughter Ivanka Trump delivered a fiery speech in support of her father's re-election bid.
""America doesn't need another empty vessel who will do whatever the media and the fringe of his party demands. Now more than ever, America needs four more years of a warrior in the White House,"" 38-year-old Ivanka said in her address to the Republican National Convention on Thursday from the South Lawn of the White House.
Introducing Trump to the audience before his presidential nomination acceptance, she said four years ago she introduced to them a builder and entrepreneur, an outsider, and the people's nominee for president of the United States.
Tonight, I stand before you as the proud daughter of the people's president. He's our commander-in-chief, champion of the American workers, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. He is our president, and my father, Donald J Trump, she said amidst loud cheer from the Republican Party supporters.
""Dad, people attack you for being unconventional but I love you for being real and I respect you for being effective,"" said Ivanka, who is also the senior advisor to the president.
She said for the first time in a long time, the US has a president who has called out Washington's hypocrisy and his rivals hate him for that.
""President refuses to surrender his beliefs to score point with the political elite. To my father, you are the elite. You are the only people he cares about scoring points with.
""If these problems were easy to solve previous presidents would have done so. But you don't achieve different results by doing things the same way,"" Ivanka said.
Ivanka said his father did not come to Washington to win praise from the Beltway elites, but to ""make America great again"".
""Washington has not changed Donald Trump. Donald Trump has changed Washington,"" she said.
She said his father has strong convictions and he knows what he believes, and he says what he thinks.
""Whether you agree with him or not, you always know where he stands. I recognise that my dad's communication style is not to everyone's taste. And I know that his tweets can feel a bit unfiltered, But the results speak for themselves, Ivanka said.
""He is so unapologetic about his beliefs that he has caused me, and countless Americans to take a hard look at our own convictions and ask ourselves, what do we stand for, what kind of America, do we want to leave for our children, she said.
Ivanka said Trump is working to build a society where every child can live in a safe community and go to a great school of their choice.
""We want a culture where differences of opinion and debate are encouraged not cancelled, where law enforcement is respected, where our country's rich diversity is celebrated, and where people of all backgrounds, races, genders and creeds have the chance to achieve their God given potential.

6317220,0,0,"India coronavirus numbers explained: Why spike in deaths, along with jump in cases, is worrying",What changed for the market while you were sleeping? Top 10 things to know,"Written by Amitabh Sinha

At the Sector 25 cremation ground in Chandigarh. (Express Photo: Jaipal Singh)India coronavirus cases and deaths: For three consecutive days now, the number of Coronavirus-related deaths in the country have exceeded 1,000. There have been days earlier when more deaths have been reported, but those have mainly been a result of some state clubbing together large number of previously unreported deaths. Never before have more than 1,000 deaths been reported on two consecutive days. And in the last three days, there has been no unusual addition of deaths from previous days.
The increase in the number of deaths have coincided with a big jump in the number of new infections being detected. More than 75,000 new cases have been discovered in the last two days. Before this, the numbers had remained well below 70,000 for more than three weeks. So, it can be tempting to correlate the rise in cases and increase in deaths as part of the same trend. But that is not the case.
 The increase in daily deaths due to Covid-19 in IndiaThe people who die are not from the same lot who are found infected on that day. They are usually from groups that are been detected positive two to three weeks earlier. There have been reports of people dying within a day or two of being detected positive, but these are small numbers. In most cases, deaths happen after several days of the person getting infected. But there is no fixed time lag, and therefore, it is difficult to correlate any particular episode of spurt in death count to any corresponding rise in the number of cases.
It is because of this reason that the case fatality numbers, a metric used regularly to assess how fatal the disease is, have also to be read with caution. India currently has a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 1.82 per cent, almost half that of the world average. This means that 1.82 per cent of people detected positive in India have died, whereas, globally this number is close to 3.4 per cent. The CFR in India has been on consistent decline, and that too is a positive sign.
But the 1.82 per cent number is slightly erroneous because it is obtained by dividing the total number of detected cases at present, with the total number of deaths that have happened. But as we have seen, people do not die the same day they are infected. The deaths happening today are from the pool of people who were infected with the disease two to three weeks earlier. So, a more accurate CFR would be obtained by using the total number of infected people from two to three weeks ago as the denominator. This would be substantially less than the number of infected people today, and therefore, a more accurate CFR would be much higher than the current 1.82 per cent.
If we use the total number of infected people from two weeks ago, the CFR goes up to about 2.4 per cent. But even this would not be entirely accurate, because, as pointed out earlier, there is no fixed time lag for the deaths. Getting an accurate CFR, when the epidemic is still evolving, required careful tracking of individual cases, and some research groups in the country are working on this.
But the real assessment of how fatal the disease has been can be known only when the full spread of the disease is known. Since most infected people are never detected, the actual number of infected people is believed to be much larger than the detected numbers show. This has been revealed by the several serological surveys conducted in the country. These surveys have suggested that the actual spread of the virus could be 20 to 40 times the numbers that are detected through diagnostic tests. In such an eventuality, the real fatality rate would be much less. Scientists believe that by the time the current epidemic comes to an end, the real fatality rate would not be more than one per cent.
 The daily rise in new Covid-19 cases in IndiaOn Thursday, more than 77,000 new cases were detected in the country, about 2,000 more than the previous day. India is not just reporting the highest number of cases in the world as of now, but it has recorded the highest number for any country anytime during this pandemic. The death count has crossed 61,500, and it is most likely to overtake the death count in Mexico by Friday. That would leave India only behind the United States and Brazil in the number of people who have succumbed to Covid-19 disease.

788691,0,0,Punjab: House passes resolution rejecting Centre’s farm ordinances,"GRAINS-Corn set for 3rd week of gains on Chinese demand; soybeans, wheat firm - reuters.com","Amarinder said that these ordinances were anti-Punjab and anti-farmer and would again descend into chaos filled era of the 1980s which the state, being a border state, can ill afford as Pakistan is waiting in the wings to derive advantage from the chaotic situation to create mayhem in the country. (File)Punjab Vidhan Sabha Friday passed a resolution rejecting the farm ordinances and proposed Electricity Bill promulgated by the Centre.
The resolution was moved by the Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and was supported by the opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Lok Insaaf Party (LIP), but was opposed by the BJP. SAD MLAs gave the sitting a miss.
Tabling the resolution, the Chief Minister said that state is seriously concerned about the apprehensions and anguished caused by the three ordinances — the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020; the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 promulgated by the Union Government — and the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020.
Amarinder said that these ordinances were anti-Punjab and anti-farmer and would again descend into chaos filled era of the 1980s which the state, being a border state, can ill afford as Pakistan is waiting in the wings to derive advantage from the chaotic situation to create mayhem in the country.
When this country was in dire straits for food security and we got grains from US, at that time Punjab stepped up for the nation and minimum support price (MSP) was introduced. It was the Shanta Kumar Commission which said that Food Corporation of India (FCI) should be wound up and MSP withdrawn. Now, they want to do away with mandis. If this happens our farmers will be ruined. We cannot accept these ordinances, he said.
Pointing out that the price support and maintenance mechanisms are necessary for MSP and ensuring National Food Security, the Chief Minister said that these ordinances would spell economic ruin for the farming sector of Punjab especially those 70 percent having less than five acres.
Amarinder added that the Electricity Amendment Bill of the Centre was discriminatory.
How can you have one power tariff all over the country. The ordinances and the electricity bill are against the federal structure of the Constitution, Amarinder added.
The CM said that this is the second time that the precious resources of Punjab are being encroached upon the first time being in 2004 when the Vidhan Sabha cancelled the river water sharing agreement and saved the state and its agrarian economy from certain doom.
Water is our life and so is MSP. If you reach for our neck then the Punjabi will speak up. What is happening? There is a need to have bigger thought and a bigger heart. The BJP MLAs present here should tell their government in the centre what trouble will be caused by this, the CM said.
The resolution passed by the House said that Entry 14 of List II of the Constitution comprises agriculture as the subject of the states, therefore these ordinances are a direct encroachment upon the functions of the states and against the spirit of cooperative federalism enshrined in the Constitution and will promote distress sale.
The resolution urges upon the Union government to withdraw these ordinances and the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020 forthwith; and instead, promulgate a fresh ordinance making the procurement of foodgrains and other agricultural produce at the Minimum Support Price (MSP), a statutory right of the farmers and continuation of government procurement through Food Corporation of India.
IN SUPPORT
Those who voiced support included Cabinet Ministers Charanjit Singh Channi, Congress MLAs Kuljit Singh Nagra and Gurkirat Singh Kotli, AAP MLAs Kanwar Sandhu and Kultar Singh Sandhwan, and Lok Insaf Party MLA Simarjit Singh Bains.
SAD ABSENT
Commenting upon the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for not being present in the Vidhan Sabha, the Chief Minister said that the party which brought Sri Anandpur Sahib resolution, knowingly absented itself from the Vidhan Sabha on such a significant occasion. He said that who would believe guarantee given by SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal who had asserted that the ordinances wont spell harm for the farm sector of Punjab.
BJP OPPOSES
BJP MLA Dinesh Singh said that there was nothing in the Ordinances against farmers. Neither is the MSP being done away with nor the mandis are being abolished. Congress has no issues so it is raising this matter. They are misleading the farmers, said the BJP MLA.

* Chicago wheat futures gain for 4th consecutive session (Recasts with move in corn prices, adds quote in paragraph 3) 
By Naveen Thukral 
SINGAPORE, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Chicago corn futures rose for a second consecutive session on Friday, while soybean prices gained on expectations of strong Chinese demand. 
Wheat is on track for a fourth consecutive session of gains. 
“The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported a hefty three quarter million tonne sale destined for China... that sale is an important validation of higher prices,” said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. 
The most-active corn contract on the Chicago Board Of Trade (CBOT) is up more than 5% for the week, gaining almost 12% over three weeks. The market was 0.1% higher at $3.58-3/4 a bushel as of 0237 GMT. 
Soybeans are up more than 4% this week, the biggest one-week percentage jump since September and wheat has added more than 3% this week. 
All three markets are poised for their third straight weekly gain. 
Private exporters reported sales of 747,000 tonnes of corn to China and 140,000 tonnes of corn to unknown destinations, the USDA said on Thursday. 
The agency said weekly export sales of wheat for shipment in the 2020/21 marketing year totalled 764,100 tonnes, topping forecasts that ranged from 400,000 tonnes to 700,000 tonnes. 
The European Union cut its duty on maize (corn) imports to zero on Thursday to take account of a rise in U.S. maize prices following a reduced forecast for the 2020/21 U.S. maize harvest, the European Commission said. 
The International Grains Council on Thursday raised its forecast for global corn production in the 2020/21 season reflecting an improved outlook for the U.S. crop. 
In its monthly update, the inter-governmental body increased its global corn crop forecast by 2 million tonnes to a record 1.166 billion tonnes. 
Commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT soybean, corn, wheat, soyoil and soymeal futures contracts on Thursday, traders said.

4382525,0,0,Buy Atul Auto target of Rs 258: Emkay Global Financial,Opinion | A (re) discovery of slow cooking,"Emkay Global Financial's report on Atul Auto
Q1FY21 results were weak due to lower volumes. Revenue declined 82% yoy to Rs265n, in line with our estimates. Net loss stood at Rs68mn, better than the estimated Rs81mn loss, owing to lower-than-expected employee expenses. Near-term volume performance is likely to remain under pressure. We expect a pick-up by FY21-end, led by replacement demand and a gradual improvement in economic activity. Market share gain is expected in FY21 on high exposure to cargo segment and launches. To strengthen presence, management continues its efforts on: 1) increasing penetration in alternative-fuel vehicles; 2) improving credit access through its group finance arm; 3) increasing presence in key export geographies; 4) launches; and 5) network expansion.
Outlook
Average ROCE is expected at 16% over FY21-23E. Valuations are inexpensive at 9x/7x P/E on FY22/23E compared to the historical average of 14x P/E. Maintain Buy with a TP of Rs258 (Rs238 earlier), based on P/E of 10x Sep22E (Mar22E earlier).

Eat.""
I just love Julie &amp; Julia, that time-shifting, languorous movie inspired by an American housewife who transforms into a master chef, eventually introducing her homeland to the slow, sometimes intricate joys of French cuisine.
Meryl Streep plays Julia Childa former intelligence operativewho, after settling into domesticity, has the conversation I refer to with her diplomat husband (who, in real life, she met on the job) in post-World-War-II France.
There was nothing rushed about the real Child, a towering, meticulous woman (at 6ft, 2 inches, she wasaccording to one storyonce considered too tall to join the US armed forces auxiliary womens services). Her videos from 1963the year my parents marriedare notable for their unhurried pace.
For instance, before she begins a recipe for French onion soup, she spends more than 10 minutes explaining how to select a knife, how to keep it sharp, how to hold an onion (practise holding it for several days,"" she advises), how to position your fingers when chopping an onionbefore getting down to the cooking.
This may seem counter-intuitive: a column that has banged on for a decade on quick cooking now eulogizing the Julia Child approach. But it is not. Like Child, I started cooking only because I liked to eat, and like her, my cooking style is changing during a defining period in life.
I would like to cook some meals too, but not at your pace,"" the wife told me one recent afternoon, with some asperity, referring to a week of relentless cooking during another covid-19-linked quarantine. Our part-time cook had tested positive and my kitchen was back entirely in my command. With my in-laws staying with us and my parents locked down in their flat, there was a substantial amount of cooking required for both families.
But my cooking style, at a time when reasonable quantities of food were required, changedagain, counter- intuitivelyand returned to a slower pace, reminiscent of a time when my cooking, and life itself, was sedate.
I have watched a ladybird frolic over a blade of grass for an hour and spent 4 hours roasting a leg of lamb, a way of life I gradually discarded around the turn of the century, when the mobile phone and the term 24x7 wrecked our collective well-being.
Certainly, there was enough to do during the quarantine, but I found I had a lot of time to do it. Locked in my house, with the kitchen and the day to myself, I found myself increasing the time I spent with each entrée.
I chopped slower. I assembled ingredients meditatively. I sautéed and simmered longer. Anything I could finish in 20 minutes stretched to an hour. I think the results were not insubstantial, in terms of taste and texture. My food looked better, and it tasted betterat least to me. When you cook all the time, the family grows tired of praising you; or if they dont like the food, they know its best to stay quiet.
As I lingered over my cooking, I decided I would give full reign to my newfound slow-cooking desires one Sunday afternoon. So, I decided to turn out a saffron and pistachio ricesimmered in vegetable stock, which had itself simmered for an houran avocado-and-fresh-tomato salad, drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, a ratatouille made with slow, roasted vegetables, and a meticulously marinated, whole slow-grilled fish.
The fish I chose was an Indian salmon, which we know as the rawas, or to use its grandiose, official name, the fourfinger threadfin. With income dwindling over the yearsentirely of our choosingand a startup to run, the spouse and I have been extra-conscious of luxuries. So, expensive white pomfret and kingfish are rarities. The rawas is an acceptable, middle-tier alternative, firm when fresh and perfect for grilling.
The weekend spread came together easy like Sunday morning. Prep occupied nearly 2 hours, but that is how it is these days, with no help and high inspiration.
I have found slow food to be more forgiving. There is more time to correct mistakes, replace missing ingredients and ensure cooking gets more attention and affection. Yes, affection. When I do not show love for what is on my burner, there is a greater probability of error and a lower likelihood of success.
Slow food also makes you unafraid. It gives you time and space to experiment, test, assess and laugh at failure. I do not intend to be immodest but little to nothing has gone wrong in my kitchen lately.
As Child said: The only real stumbling block is fear of failure. In cooking, you have got to have a what-the-hell attitude."" Quite.

5618989,0,0,James Anderson sets sights on Ashes tour next year,Winker leads Reds past Brewers in Game 1 - Reuters,"By: PTI | Southampton | 
Updated: August 28, 2020 1:41:27 pm
England pacer James Anderson has set his sights on next year's Ashes series. (Reuters/File Photo) After becoming the first fast bowler to amass 600 Test wickets, veteran England pacer James Anderson has set his sights on next year’s Ashes series, saying he will do “everything he can” to play in Australia.
The 38-year-old made his red-ball debut in 2003. Since then he has become England’s leading wicket taker and has earned 156 caps Test caps, including playing in four Ashes tours of Australia.
“I will be doing everything I can to be on that plane to Australia. I’m still hungry to take wickets, I still love playing the game, so I will keep trying to improve and stay fit,” he told ‘BBC Breakfast’.
The Ashes series is scheduled to be played between November 2021 and January 2022 in Australia. Anderson believes if he continues taking wickets he has a shot at getting selected for the series.
Can James Anderson reach the 700-mark? He says why not?
“If I can keep taking wickets in the coming months, then hopefully I will be on that plane,” the pacer said.
Earlier this week, Anderson became only the fourth bowler and first pacer to take 600 wickets in the longest format of the game. He touched the milestone on the fifth day of the drawn third Test against Pakistan when he dismissed rival skipper Azhar Ali.
Only retired spinners Muttiah Muralitharan (800), Shane Warne (708) and Anil Kumble (619) have more wickets than him in Test cricket.
Anderson said his natural built and hard work has helped him stretch his career and hopes injury will not mar his plans of playing a bit longer.
“I’ve been really lucky I’ve got the body that I have. I’m very slight naturally which has helped. The bulkier guys do struggle with the forces that go through your body,” Anderson said.
“I do work hard in the gym to make my action as economical as possible so there’s not too much stress going through my body. Fingers crossed I stay injury free and I can play a little bit longer,” he added.

For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App.","Jesse Winker homered twice and Sonny Gray threw five shutout innings as the visiting Cincinnati Reds snapped a four-game skid by winning 6-1 in Game 1 of Thursday’s doubleheader against the Milwaukee Brewers. 
It’s the first doubleheader in the history of Milwaukee’s Miller Park, and just the second between these two clubs all time. The Reds and Brewers mutually agreed to boycott Wednesday’s scheduled contest in the wake of unrest and violence following Sunday’s police shooting involving black 29-year-old Jacob Blake, in nearby Kenosha, Wis. 
Winker and Nick Castellanos combined to go 6-for-6 with two homers and five RBIs as the Reds broke out after totaling just six runs in their previous four contests. Gray (5-1), meanwhile, allowed four hits and two walks while striking out four in going five of the seven-inning game. 
Omar Narvaez homered in the sixth inning for Milwaukee, which won the first two games of the set, on Monday and Tuesday. Teammate Orlando Arcia recorded two hits for the Brewers. 
Cincinnati opened the scoring in the second inning via Curt Casali’s RBI single off Brewers starter Adrian Houser. The Reds went up 2-0 when Castellanos crushed a shot to center field for his 10th homer of 2020 in the third inning. Winker immediately followed with an opposite-field home run to left for a 3-0 Cincinnati advantage. 
Winker did it again in the fifth, this time a two-run homer to left-center field for his eighth of the season. It came off Milwaukee reliever Alex Claudio, but one of those runs was charged to Houser (1-3). The right-hander pitched into the fifth, and allowed four runs and nine hits while fanning three and walking one. 
Winker is 9-for-18 with two homers against Milwaukee this season. 
Castellanos added a sacrifice fly in the sixth inning to pad Cincinnati’s advantage before Narvaez got Milwaukee on the board in the bottom half of the frame.

2245058,0,0,'Heartwrenching': at least 40 dolphins dead near Mauritius oil spill,"Pre-launch bookings of BSVI-compliant G 310 R, G 310 GS from September 1","(Reuters) - At least 40 dolphins have mysteriously died in an area of Mauritius affected by an oil spill from a Japanese boat, officials and witnesses said on Friday, as witnesses described the deaths of one mother dolphin and her baby. 
Environmentalists have demanded an investigation into whether the dolphins were killed as a result of the spill from a Japanese ship, which was scuttled on Monday after running aground in July and leaking oil. 
The death toll may rise: fisherman Yasfeen Heenaye said he saw between 25 and 30 apparently dead dolphins floating in the lagoon on Friday morning, among scores of the animals that fishermen were trying to herd away from the pollution. 
“There was a mother and her baby,” he said. “He was very tired, he didn’t swim well. But the mum stayed alongside him, she didn’t leave her baby to go with the group. All the way she stayed with him. She was trying to protect him.” 
He filmed as the calf wallowed on its side and died in front of them, floating on the waves. [L4N2FU44Q] 
Heenaye, his boat running low on fuel, motioned to Reuben Pillay, who tracked the mother dolphin. She initially looked normal, he said. 
“But in a few minutes she went on her side, one fin in the water, and one out of the water and then she started flapping her tail really really rapidly,” said Pillay, a professional drone operator and environmentalist who is providing video to Reuters. 
“She swam in circles in front of the boat, she moved her tail very violently and after about five minutes she just stopped moving, and she sunk ... We heard cries, I thought it was a woman on the boat - but they told me, no - it was the dolphin.” 
The mother dolphin stopped moving and eventually slowly sank, tail first, beneath the waves. The dead baby floated on the surface. 
“We didn’t know what to do. It was heartwrenching,” Pillay said. 
Earlier in the day, Jasvin Sok Appadu from the Mauritius fisheries ministry told Reuters that 38 carcasses had washed up on the beaches so far. 
Autopsy results on 25 dolphins that washed ashore Wednesday and Thursday are expected in the coming days, he said. 
So far veterinarians have examined only two of the dolphins, which bore signs of injury but no trace of hydrocarbons in their bodies, according to preliminary autopsy results. The autopsy on the first two was conducted by the government-run Albion Fisheries Research Centre. 
The dolphins have been dying in an area affected by an oil spill caused when the Japanese ship, the MV Wakashio, struck a coral reef last month. 
On Thursday, Greenpeace called on the government of Mauritius to launch an “urgent investigation to determine the cause of the deaths and any ties to the Wakashio oil spill”.

Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie was born in Villers-Cotterêts, France in 1802. He would later assume the surname of his paternal grandmother Marie-Césette Dumas, a woman of African descent and a slave in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti).
As a child, Dumas was regaled with stories of his late fathers exploits as a general, elements of which later found their way into some of the writers most famous works.
Before becoming a novelist, Dumas found success as a playwright when he moved to Paris in 1822. In the 1840s, he hit upon monumental success with his action-packed serialized novels, including Les Troi Mousquetaires (The Three Musketeers), which was published in 1844.
Dumas works have made him one of the most popular French authors in the world and his books have been translated into over 100 languages.

2167930,0,0,"Peru, with world's deadliest outbreak, readies to start vaccine tests - Reuters Africa",Global coronavirus caseload crosses 24.3 million mark: Johns Hopkins,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru will start testing coronavirus vaccines from China’s Sinopharm and U.S. drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson in September, researchers said, which should help the country gain faster access to inoculations once the vaccines are approved. 
Sinopharm began this week to recruit up to 6,000 volunteers in Peru, which Reuters data indicates has the highest number of COVID-19 deaths in relation to its population size. A team of Chinese scientists is expected to arrive in the Andean nation next week to work with local researchers, said Germán Málaga, a doctor and lead vaccine investigator at Lima’s Cayetano Heredia University. 
“This is going to happen around Sept. 3, to begin vaccinations on Sept. 8,” he said. Sinopharm’s clinical trials in Peru are being done with Cayetano Heredia and the state-run Universidad Mayor de San Marcos. 
Peru has recorded around 622,000 cases of the coronavirus, the fifth highest case load in the world, and 28,277 deaths. It now has the world’s deadliest fatality rate per capita, with 86.67 deaths per 100,000 people, a Reuters tally shows, just ahead of Belgium. 
Sinopharm will also do clinical coronavirus vaccine trials elsewhere in Latin America, including in Argentina. 
Other Chinese laboratories that will be conducting trials in the region include Sinovac Biotech, which will work in Brazil and Chile, and Walvax Biotechnology Co Ltd and CanSino Biologics Inc, which will test in Mexico, authorities have said. 
Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen unit will start tests with some 4,000 volunteers in Peru around Sept. 24, Prime Minister Walter Martos told reporters on Thursday. 
“We are contacting other companies, laboratories, from Britain and other countries that are going to help us immunize at least 70% of the local population,” Martos said. 
J&amp;J said earlier this week that it would conduct Phase III trials for its vaccine in Chile, Argentina and Peru. 
Peru, a country of nearly 33 million people and the world’s no. 2 copper producer, has been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic, both in terms of infections and economic impact. The economy crumbled over 30% in the second quarter of the year. 
The death toll could also be higher than official figures suggest. A national registry shows that between April and August there were 68,192 more deaths compared to the same period in 2019. Excess deaths often give a better indication of the true number of fatalities. 
Researcher Málaga and Carlos Castillo, the chief adviser for immunizations and vaccines at Peru’s health ministry, said that carrying out clinical trials would help Peru get faster access to vaccines when they were ready. 
“There is an unwritten agreement, in the sense that in the country where a clinical trial is being carried out, it has priority access to vaccine availability,” Castillo said.

We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma,"" he said on Thursday night.
You saw that on Sunday night when we announced that we'll save thousands and thousands of lives. Thanks to advances, we have pioneered the fatality rate. And you look at it and you look at the numbers, it has been reduced by 80 per cent since April,"" Trump said.
Trump delivered his speech to a group of over 1,000 supporters on the South Lawn of the White House. Many did not wear face masks and were seated close together.
The US is among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world, Trump said.
The European Union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours, but you don't hear that. They don't write about that. They don't want to write about that. They don't want you to know those things.
All together, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30 per cent greater increase and excess mortality than the United States,"" said the president.
In recent months, the United States and the world has been hit by the once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe.
They could have stopped it but they allowed it to come out. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude,"" he said.
Criticising his Democratic Party rival Joe Biden, Trump said unlike the former vice president, his administration focuses on the science, the facts and the data"" to handle the coronavirus pandemic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.,,,,"" Trump, who had earlier dismissed the pandemic as not a major health issue for the country, said.
Many Americans, including him, sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease, Trump said.
As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that had been so tragically taken. So unnecessary.
In their honour, we will unite. In their memory, we will overcome. And when the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilisation since World War II. Invoking the Defence Production Act, we produced the world's largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator which is a miracle,"" Trump added.
More than 180,000 people have died from the coronavirus pandemic since the start of the outbreak in the US, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
Nearly 5.8 million cases have also been confirmed nationwide, making America the worst-hit country in the world after the disease emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year.
Trump repeatedly claimed there would be a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, and also implied it could be available sooner.
We are delivering life-saving therapies, and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner,"" Trump said at one point.
We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before.
Nobody thought it could ever be done this fast. We are producing them in advance, so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available,"" Trump said.
We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year,"" Trump assured, and together we will crush the virus.""
""Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticise,"" Trump said.
""When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died,"" he said.

Join Livemint channel in your Telegram and stay updated","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, accepting the Republican nomination for a second term, said on Thursday that he alone stands as a bulwark against the forces of socialism, anarchy and extremism that his Democratic rival Joe Biden would champion if elected in November. 
Speaking from the White House South Lawn despite criticism he was using the executive residence as a political prop, Trump asserted that a Biden victory would only worsen the crises besieging the country. 
“This election will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny.” Trump said on the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention. “This election will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans, or whether we give free rein to violent anarchic agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens.” 
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, Trump delivered his remarks in front of more than 1,000 people, standing in front of dozens of American flags and basking in chants of “Four more years!” and “U.S.A.!” 
Though an incumbent seeking a second four-year term, Trump remains a self-styled outsider, an approach that won him the White House, his first elected office, in 2016 on a promise to end the crime and violence he said was afflicting the country. 
On Thursday, he and other Republican speakers argued that state and city Democratic leaders, not the Trump administration, were to blame for the racial strife convulsing U.S. cities, including Kenosha, Wisconsin, where this week police shot and paralysed a Black man. 
“No one will be safe in Biden’s America,” Trump said despite the surge of unrest during his watch. 
As the night unfolded, Biden struck back on Twitter, writing, “When Donald Trump says tonight you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump’s America?” 
The made-for-television scene - befitting the first reality TV host to serve as president - stood in marked contrast to Biden’s acceptance speech last week, which was broadcast live from a largely empty arena in a nod to the disease. 
The crowd, seated in white chairs inches apart, showed little evidence of social distancing or face masks despite health experts’ recommendations. 
The coronavirus prompted both political parties to scale back their conventions and make events mostly virtual. The Trump campaign said it had taken appropriate health precautions. 
In a reminder of the country’s divisions, attendees could hear anti-Trump protesters at nearby Black Lives Matter Plaza as he spoke. 
MORE THAN 180,000 DEATHS 
More than 180,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus - more than any other country, according to a Reuters tally - amid a fresh wave of protests over the latest high-profile police shooting of a Black American. 
In Kenosha, relative calm returned after three nights of civil strife ending on Tuesday, including arson, vandalism and deadly shootings. 
Trump, a former New York real estate developer, is seeking to turn around a re-election campaign that has been largely overshadowed by a health crisis that has put millions of Americans out of work. 
In his speech on Thursday, Trump repeated his assertion that China is to blame for the pandemic and promised to rebuild what Republicans have called the “greatest economy” in history. But opinion polls have shown most Americans are disappointed in his response to the coronavirus, which he played down for weeks. 
While his approval rating among Republican voters remains high, dissent is mounting within the party. In three open letters being published on Thursday and Friday, Biden won endorsements from more than 160 people who worked for Republican former President George W. Bush or for past Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, the New York Times and Politico reported. 
Earlier this week, 27 former Republican lawmakers endorsed Biden while the Lincoln Project, among the most prominent Republican-backed groups opposing Trump, said a former Republican Party head had joined it as a senior adviser. 
Thursday’s program aimed to counterbalance those defections, featuring a video showcasing former Democratic voters who say they now support Trump and remarks from U.S. Representative Jeff Van Drew, who abandoned the Democratic Party to join the Republicans after voting against Trump’s impeachment this year. 
“Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,” he said. 
The program also included several emotional appeals, including from the parents of Kayla Mueller, an aid worker who died after being held captive for months by Islamic State militants in Syria. The Mueller parents said they blamed the Obama administration for failing to rescue Mueller. 
The Republican convention has attracted fewer television viewers than its Democratic counterpart on two of its three nights so far, including on Wednesday, according to early Nielsen Media Research. 
A total of 17.3 million people watched the third night of the mostly virtual Republican National Convention on Wednesday, according to Nielsen, fewer than the 22.8 million viewers for the third night of last week’s Democratic convention. 
Trump kicked off the week on Monday by accusing Democrats of seeking to steal the election by advocating for mail-in voting. His previous high-profile speeches have also emphasized grim themes, including his inaugural address in January 2017 that described “American carnage.”

1816611,0,0,Movie Review: Sadak 2 - 2/5,What to watch on August 28: Masaba Masaba is streaming on Netflix,"STORY: After her mother Shakuntala Desais death under mysterious circumstances, the Desai Group of Industries scion Aarya (Alia Bhatt) vows to avenge the murder and bring the culprits to justice. And, in order to honour her mothers last wish, Aarya embarks on a journey to Kailash and the story of Sadak 2 unfolds.REVIEW: Her entire family comprising the maasi-turned-step-mother Nandini Maa (Priyanka Bose) and father Yogesh (Jisshu Sengupta) is under the spell of dhongi sadhu Gyaan Prakash (Makarand Deshpande) but Aarya, all of 20, knows better. Utterly convinced that her beloved mother died owing to an elaborate plan hatched by Gyaan Prakash and that disease Nandini, Aarya launches an online campaign called India Fights Fake Gurus. Her motivation is to reveal the truth behind these supposed messengers of God and debunk the myth and mystery surrounding them. While treading along this mission, Aarya falls in love with a former troll a very good-looking musician with issues of his own, Vishal (Aditya Roy Kapur). Together, they embark on a pilgrimage to fulfil Aaryas maa-ka-aakhri-sapna of visiting Kailash on her 21st birthday.
However, there is a small hurdle the booking agent/ co-owner of Pooja Travels and Tours (that guarantees safety and security 24*7) is now dead and her taxi driver husband Ravis (Sanjay Dutt) only purpose in life is to reunite with her in Heaven. After much cajoling and persuasion, the heartbroken cabbie reluctantly says yes. Soon after, they find solace in each other and a unique friendship blossoms that is a win-win for both Aarya derives strength and hope from the lonely man and Ravi seeks a new purpose in life through this young girl driven to achieve what she is set out to do.
Back in the 90s, when Sadak, starring Sanjay Dutt and Pooja Bhatt, hit the theatres, it was such a rage among the audience; for two reasons: the incredible love ballads and its engaging plotline. 20 years on, Mahesh Bhatt conjures up a script to take that story on the road again. 
Sadak 2 starts off with a grim, almost melancholic setting, where the hopeless protagonist Ravi is tying a rope around his neck and talking to his deceased wife Pooja about their impending reunion in the afterlife. But the fan that he is hanging on to comes crashing down, and Ravi has to live another day. While listening to Hum Tere Bin Kahin Reh Nahin Paate (such nostalgia, much wow!) in his garage and planning yet another exit, his door bolts open and a hyper Aarya storms in demanding her three-month advance booking be honoured. Thus, begins a journey of random twists-and-turns, both on the road and off it, and a screenplay that goes down various routes and eventually hits a dead-end.
We dont know where to begin with: the dialogues are dated and over the top. Its been decades since we heard anyone in the movies say Jo garjte hai woh baraste nahi or Aadmi karz lauta sakta hain, ehsaan nahin. No matter what the logic is, co-writers Pushpdeep Bhardwaj, Mahesh Bhatt and Suhrita Sengupta could have done much better with the writing that is so passé. Now shifting focus to the set design and overall look-and-feel of the movie: the gundas wear flashy and eye-popping outfits, big wigs and enact dramatic knife-wielding scenes on camera topped with caricaturish action sequences. The background score by Sandeep Chowta deserves a special mention here and not for the right reasons its melodramatic and borderline annoying. 
Alia Bhatt, who is known for her fine performances on screen, falls flat this one time. Apart from a few emotional scenes, this act - by her own high standards - is strictly average. Aditya Roy Kapur doesnt have much role to play besides looking smoking hot and after a point, he appears aloof and even takes a back seat. Sanjay Dutt pulls off his emotional scenes quite well with those welled-up bulgy eyes doing all the talking. Even at this age, he sure knows how to bring off an action sequence taking down the baddies one by one. In a smaller role, Jisshu Sengupta as Alias daddy is impactful and he totally owns the few frames that he has in this action-drama. On the other hand, seasoned actors like Makarand Deshpande and Priyanka Bose deliver some unbelievably overblown acting. Their pseudo holy/ satanic act is hilarious to the core and quite frankly, at times we wonder whether to laugh or cry even during the emotionally-charged scenes. 
It is rather disappointing to see a filmmaker of Mahesh Bhatts stature to make a comeback as a director with Sadak 2. No offense but why this, Bhatt saab?
In a nutshell, Sadak 2, for everyone involved with this project, should have been a road not taken. And for those who are planning on watching this purely for sentimental reasons, be forewarned: This Sadak leads nowhere; turn back. Jai Guru ji!","Masaba Masaba is available on Netflix.Cinema halls might be far away from reopening doors, but theres no dearth of content for viewers to binge-watch. To say that the web became a saviour to quench our thirst for entertainment during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, wont be wrong. Streaming giants like ZEE5, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus Hotstar, Voot Select, SonyLIV and several others are regularly churning out new stuff for its viewers. Adding to it are dozens of movies premiering on OTT platforms.
This weeks big OTT releases include Sadak 2, which marks the return of Mahesh Bhatt as a director after 21 years. This is also the first time he is collaborating with daughter Alia Bhatt, who will share screen space with Aditya Roy Kapur. Sadak actor Sanjay Dutt is also making a comeback in the sequel. Sadak 2 is a sequel to Bhatts 1991 directorial Sadak, which also starred Pooja Bhatt and Sadashiv Amrapurkar. Going by the trailer of Sadak 2, it looks like the movie is a revenge drama against a godman, played by Makarand Deshpande. While Dutt is seen reprising his role as a taxi driver from the original film, Alia and Aditya are lovers who rent his services, until the trio strike a bond against the common enemy. Produced by Vishesh Films, Sadak 2 will premiere on Disney Plus Hotstar VIP.
Also releasing this weekend is actor Bobby Deol and director Prakash Jhas web series Aashram on MX Player. Bobby, who was recently seen playing a police officer in Netflix film Class of 83, will be seen as a godman in the series, which also features Chandan Roy Sanyal, Aaditi Pohankar, Darshan Kumaar, and Adhyayan Suman in pivotal roles.
Netflix series Masaba Masaba will see mother-daughter duo Masaba Gupta and Neena Gupta onscreen for the first time. The show, which releases on Friday, is based on their real-life moments and offers a peek into their journey, with references and anecdotes set against a fictional backdrop.
Talking about Aashram, Bobby Deol told indianexpress.com, The most attractive thing about Aashram was that it gave me a chance to work with Prakash ji (director Prakash Jha). All these years, I had been watching his movies, waiting to work with him one day. I was so excited the day he called me to his office, and when he narrated the idea to me, I was like wow.

5042250,0,1,"NEET, JEE: 6 states seek review of SC order","Coronavirus India Updates, 28 August: Recoveries near 26 lakh; Defence ministry announces next edition of Aero-India","NEW DELHI: A review petition has been filed by six opposition ruled state governments against an order of the Supreme Court dated August 17 vide which it had allowed the Centre to hold the National Eligibility cum Entrance test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) in September.
Cabinet Ministers of six states have sought a review. The States are: West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Rajasthan.
A Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra, on August 17, had dismissed pleas seeking deferment of JEE Main 2020 and NEET UG examinations which are slated to be held in September.
Pursuant to the August 17 order of the Apex Court, the National Testing Agency (NTA)- earlier this week- notified that the said entrance examination would be conducted as per the revised schedule with the NEET on September 13 and the JEE on September 16.
The review petitions now state the Supreme Courts judgment and the NTAs decision to conduct the said exams, in the midst of the pandemic, is ""flawed"".
The petitioners have contended that the said decision fails to ensure the safety, security and right to life of the student candidates appearing for the said exams.
The review petitions further state that the NTA has ignored the logistical difficulties in carrying the examinations on the proposed dates and also failed to balance the competing but equally crucial aspect of conducting the examination and safety of the students. The review petitioners have also raised the issue of lack of mandatory safeguards for carrying the examinations.
The review petitioners have stated that nearly 25 lakh students will appear for the examinations in the midst of the pandemic and at a time when the country has recorded over 3.31 million COVID-19 cases.
With JEE being proposed to be conducted in over 660 exam centres for 9.53 lakh students, roughly 1,443 students will be writing the exam per JEE centre and for the NEET UG exams, 15.97 lakh students are slated to appear in 3,843 centres, meaning that there will be 415 students per NEET exam centre, the pleas state.
The review petitions have been filed by the Cabinet Ministers of six states in their individual capacities.
These are Moloy Ghatak, Minister-in-Charge, Department of Labour &amp; E.S.I. (MB) Scheme and Departments of Law &amp; Judicial, West Bengal; Dr Rameshwar Oraon, Finance Minister, Jharkhand; Dr Raghu Sharma, Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Rajasthan; Amarjeet Bhagat, Indian Minister of Food, Civil supplies, Culture, Planning, Chhattisgarh; Balbir Singh Sidhu, Minister of Health and Family Welfare &amp; Labour, Punjab and Uday Ravindra Samant, Minister of Higher and Technical Education, Maharashtra.
Challenging the SC decision, the review petitioners have said that the Apex Court failed to appreciate that the Union Government had adequate time to establish at least one centre for every district for NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) rather than having several centres in one district. Having at least one centre per district would have minimised the inter-district long travel of the students and thereby reduced the chances of COVID-19 spread.","TMC's student wing protest against the NEET exam dates in Kolkata on Thursday.
Coronavirus India Updates: The Covid-19 recoveries in India have exceeded the active cases by over 18 lakh as of Friday while there has been a huge reduction in the fatality rate, the Centre, highlighting its ‘test, track and treat’ approach, said today. With more patients recovering and being discharged from home isolation and hospitals, the country’s recoveries is nearing 26 lakh, it added.
“Effective treatment of positive cases has resulted in a progressively dipping Covid case fatality rate, which is pegged at 1.82 per cent as on date,” the Union health ministry said.
With 77,266 cases in 24 hours, the Covid-19 tally in India rose to 3,387,500 earlier in the day with the death toll at 61,529.
Here is a look at the top developments: 
In its latest set of coronavirus guidelines for flyers, the Centre has allowed airlines to serve pre-packed snacks, meals and beverages on domestic flights depending on the travel time, and hot meals on international flights.
Besides this, the government has also directed passengers who refuse to wear a face mask in a flight to be put on the no-fly list, a senior official of the aviation regulator DGCA said. The airline and its cabin crew are sufficiently empowered under the existing DGCA rules to take action in this regard, the official added.
Airlines may serve pre-packed snacks/meals/pre-packed beverages on domestic flights depending on the duration of flight, an order issued by the Civil Aviation Ministry said on Thursday.

A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan and comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah left it to the Election Commission decide the schedule.
The apex court was hearing a petition filed by one Avinash Thakur, who sought direction to the Chief Election Commissioner to postpone the election till the state was free of Covid-19.
The SC also said the petition was premature, as the EC was yet to announce the schedule for the elections. The poll body, however, has announced a slew of guidelines for holding elections during the pandemic.

Targeting the BJP over the holding of the JEE and NEET exams amid the pandemic, Samajwadi Party Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said the party’s attitude towards students is “devoid of humanity”.
“Adamant on conducting JEE and NEET examinations, BJP has now clarified why it has changed the name of the Ministry of Human Resources. It is because its attitude towards education and students is devoid of humanity,” the former chief minister tweeted while tagging pictures of the protest by his partymen in the state capital on Thursday.
The Supreme Court today said that states and universities cannot promote students without holding final year exams. The court, however, added that they can approach the University Grants Commission (UGC) to seek an extension of deadline for holding the exams. Earlier, the UGC guidelines had asked universities to hold the exams by September 30.
States can postpone final year exams under Disaster Management Act but fresh dates have to be fixed in consultation with UGC, it said.

7535606,0,1,Is Ivanka Trump going to change anyone’s mind?,"Trump, Republicans attack Biden amid coronavirus crisis, street protests","Ivanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter, during a roundtable with President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington. (Doug Mills/The New York Times/File)Written by Elaina Plott
On night four of the Republican National Convention, viewers knew her as The Honorable Ivanka Trump.
The title was a nod to her senior role in the White House (though official titular etiquette is somewhat unclear). The speaking gig was not. While the White House insists she was appearing on her own time, and only in her capacity as President Donald Trumps eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump introduced the president Thursday evening before he addresses the convention from the White House lawn, an overtly political use of federal property and potential violation of the Hatch Act.
For Ivanka Trump, who has spent the past few years flitting between her dual roles as first daughter and senior adviser, these are little more than details.
It is in many ways a fitting framework for her appearance, underscoring the extent to which she has unabashedly embraced the near-nonexistent lines between the personal, political and governmental that have defined her fathers approach to politics almost as much as the divisiveness his brand thrives on.
Ivanka Trumps perceived distance from that part of his brand was once her greatest asset. Her 2016 convention appearance, for example, was intended in large part to reach suburban women. The campaign believed they might see the presidents eldest daughter as a more centrist and professional counterpart to a firebrand candidate with a history of misogynistic behavior. And ahead of Thursday, as the penultimate act of a convention that has already been tailored in large part to such women, aides were hopeful she could reach the same audience and communicate a similar appeal.
Trump urged voters to look beyond her fathers rhetoric and tone and judge him for his policies. I recognize that my dads communication style is not to everyones taste. And I know his tweets can feel a bit unfiltered, she said. But the results speak for themselves.
She cited her own work in increasing the child care tax credit and said the president had fulfilled his promise to support mothers in the workforce.
Four years ago, I told you I would fight alongside my father, Trump said, and four years later, here I am.
In 2016, Trump was one of the campaigns most requested surrogates, her cosmopolitan affect and apolitical rhetoric serving as a balm of sorts for women who might have been drawn to the idea of a businessman in the White House but would never be caught dead chanting Build the wall! Yet she kept a light footprint on the trail.
Now, however, she is eager to do more for her fathers reelection bid, fully embracing an explicitly political role. For Donald Trumps campaign, the question is whether Ivanka Trumps transformation will complicate her pitch to moderate Republicans and swing voters who once liked that she seemed to be more of a check than a rubber stamp on her fathers agenda.
When voters look at Ivanka in and of herself and the issues she focuses on, they generally have a positive response to her, said Lorna Romero, a GOP strategist in Arizona, where the presidents chances in November likely hinge on moderate Republican women, many of whom have felt alienated from the party under Donald Trump.
Four years later, they recognize how, not just as his daughter, but as his senior adviser, she is going along with the presidents rhetoric and policies theyre not supportive of, she went on. Its a more conflicted opinion.
When Ivanka Trump made her political debut in 2016, voters who only knew her name from The Apprentice or from a rack of accessibly priced sheath dresses at Macys were subtly encouraged by the campaign to see in her a moderating influence. While her father was toying with a Muslim travel ban, or suggesting that Russian officials look into Hillary Clintons emails, Trump was discussing the punishing cost of child care and her passion for womens issues in the pages of Harpers Bazaar.
The campaign was confident that women might see her silence on the most controversial elements of her fathers campaign as daughterly deference to the tactics needed to win an election, rather than tacit approval.
Ivanka Trump now has the burden of the incumbency, nearly four years by which voters may judge whether the original cornerstones of her appeal a moderating effect, a stated commitment to a more progressive agenda on issues like climate change have in fact borne out.
In March 2017, Saturday Night Live aired a sketch that called her complicit in the administrations early actions, such as a Muslim travel ban, and since then Trump has complained privately about the moderating influence moniker, arguing it was an image foisted upon her by others that never reflected her own views. This is in many ways accurate: At no point in her fathers 2016 campaign did Trump suggest she was against, say, building a wall along the southern border, locking up his opponent or any other element at the core of his candidacy.
Whether this softer public image was accurate or not, it is also true that early on in her White House tenure, Ivanka Trump cared a great deal about protecting it. She made clear her support of the Paris climate accord and her attempts to prevent her father from withdrawing from the pact, which were ultimately unsuccessful. Coverage of the first daughter often included anonymous quotes from people described as close to the family and familiar with her thoughts revealing her disapproval of whatever firestorm had just engulfed the West Wing.
At a certain point, however, Trump seemed to tire of maintaining the pretense of being a responsible stewardess of taxpayer dollars. If her constructed identity was meant to keep suburban women with the president, the midterm elections in 2018 showed it wasnt working.
With that clear, she appeared to change her own behavior, becoming more comfortable publicly embracing what proximity to the leader of the free world had to offer: hobnobbing with foreign leaders during high-profile trips overseas, joining her father for a historic exchange with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in the Demilitarized Zone. For many of those ventures, even Trump herself may have struggled to articulate why her presence was necessary, how her portfolio of womens economic empowerment bore relevance. But she increasingly felt less obligated to try. (On that June day in Seoul, she told reporters that women will play an enormous role in ushering in peace for the peninsula.)
She is certainly an unconventional first daughter, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. She seems to have endless access to anything and everything that goes on in the White House shes actually serving in many ways as a second first lady. Weve never had that before.
On a policy front, despite early setbacks, Trump has notched victories such as increasing the child tax credit as part of the presidents tax cuts in 2017. She has also rallied many Republicans behind the goal of passing paid family leave legislation, a topic that before Donald Trumps tenure rarely gained momentum in GOP circles.
But any strides she has made as a bipartisan convener have at times been overshadowed by her increasing willingness to enter the political fray, an arena she was once content to let the rest of her family, especially her brother Donald Trump Jr., navigate without her.
Earlier this year, she embarked on a more active role in her fathers reelection bid. She attended the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering of conservative activists, and went on to schedule multicity fundraising swings, relishing in her ability, as she put it, to raise record-shattering amounts for the campaign.
She now frequently uses her Twitter feed to defend her father, a stark contrast from the posed family photos and occasional policy thoughts she once shared. In October 2019, as the House moved forward with impeachment proceedings against her father, Trump shared a Thomas Jefferson quote about the enemies and spies among his political opposition. In July, she tweeted a photo of herself holding a can of Goya beans, praising the brand after its CEOs support for the president sparked calls for a boycott.
In introducing her father Thursday, Trump sounded many of the same notes as she did in 2016, reassuring voters of the presidents commitment to helping working families, as well as her own dedication to womens empowerment and the kitchen-table issues that transcend party lines.
This time, she will leave no doubt about the precise nature of her political identity, and to what extent it aligns with her fathers. As she officially announced earlier this year, Trump is now a proud Trump Republican.

For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, accepting the Republican nomination for a second term, said on Thursday that he alone stands as a bulwark against the forces of socialism, anarchy and extremism that his Democratic rival Joe Biden would champion if elected in November. 
Speaking from the White House South Lawn despite criticism he was using the executive residence as a political prop, Trump asserted that a Biden victory would only worsen the crises besieging the country. 
“This election will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny.” Trump said on the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention. “This election will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans, or whether we give free rein to violent anarchic agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens.” 
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, Trump delivered his remarks in front of more than 1,000 people, standing in front of dozens of American flags and basking in chants of “Four more years!” and “U.S.A.!” 
Though an incumbent seeking a second four-year term, Trump remains a self-styled outsider, an approach that won him the White House, his first elected office, in 2016 on a promise to end the crime and violence he said was afflicting the country. 
On Thursday, he and other Republican speakers argued that state and city Democratic leaders, not the Trump administration, were to blame for the racial strife convulsing U.S. cities, including Kenosha, Wisconsin, where this week police shot and paralysed a Black man. 
“No one will be safe in Biden’s America,” Trump said despite the surge of unrest during his watch. 
As the night unfolded, Biden struck back on Twitter, writing, “When Donald Trump says tonight you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump’s America?” 
The made-for-television scene - befitting the first reality TV host to serve as president - stood in marked contrast to Biden’s acceptance speech last week, which was broadcast live from a largely empty arena in a nod to the disease. 
The crowd, seated in white chairs inches apart, showed little evidence of social distancing or face masks despite health experts’ recommendations. 
The coronavirus prompted both political parties to scale back their conventions and make events mostly virtual. The Trump campaign said it had taken appropriate health precautions. 
In a reminder of the country’s divisions, attendees could hear anti-Trump protesters at nearby Black Lives Matter Plaza as he spoke. 
MORE THAN 180,000 DEATHS 
More than 180,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus - more than any other country, according to a Reuters tally - amid a fresh wave of protests over the latest high-profile police shooting of a Black American. 
In Kenosha, relative calm returned after three nights of civil strife ending on Tuesday, including arson, vandalism and deadly shootings. 
Trump, a former New York real estate developer, is seeking to turn around a re-election campaign that has been largely overshadowed by a health crisis that has put millions of Americans out of work. 
In his speech on Thursday, Trump repeated his assertion that China is to blame for the pandemic and promised to rebuild what Republicans have called the “greatest economy” in history. But opinion polls have shown most Americans are disappointed in his response to the coronavirus, which he played down for weeks. 
While his approval rating among Republican voters remains high, dissent is mounting within the party. In three open letters being published on Thursday and Friday, Biden won endorsements from more than 160 people who worked for Republican former President George W. Bush or for past Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, the New York Times and Politico reported. 
Earlier this week, 27 former Republican lawmakers endorsed Biden while the Lincoln Project, among the most prominent Republican-backed groups opposing Trump, said a former Republican Party head had joined it as a senior adviser. 
Thursday’s program aimed to counterbalance those defections, featuring a video showcasing former Democratic voters who say they now support Trump and remarks from U.S. Representative Jeff Van Drew, who abandoned the Democratic Party to join the Republicans after voting against Trump’s impeachment this year. 
“Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,” he said. 
The program also included several emotional appeals, including from the parents of Kayla Mueller, an aid worker who died after being held captive for months by Islamic State militants in Syria. The Mueller parents said they blamed the Obama administration for failing to rescue Mueller. 
The Republican convention has attracted fewer television viewers than its Democratic counterpart on two of its three nights so far, including on Wednesday, according to early Nielsen Media Research. 
A total of 17.3 million people watched the third night of the mostly virtual Republican National Convention on Wednesday, according to Nielsen, fewer than the 22.8 million viewers for the third night of last week’s Democratic convention. 
Trump kicked off the week on Monday by accusing Democrats of seeking to steal the election by advocating for mail-in voting. His previous high-profile speeches have also emphasized grim themes, including his inaugural address in January 2017 that described “American carnage.”

3763303,0,1,NBA ready to resume games after players' racial injustice boycott - Reuters Africa,"Trump, Republicans attack Joe Biden amid coronavirus crisis, street protests","(Reuters) - The National Basketball Association (NBA) said on Thursday it hopes to resume play in a day or two after a boycott by players protesting racial injustice and police brutality, while President Donald Trump denounced the league. 
NBA Executive Vice President Mike Bass said the league is “hopeful” it will resume games Friday or Saturday after the protest, which was sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and led to game cancellations in other sports as well. 
The NBA players, a majority of whom are Black, decided not to extend the boycott in a meeting on their quarantined campus at Disney World in Florida, where games have occurred due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Trump, during a briefing on Hurricane Laura on Thursday, criticized the NBA for postponing six games in response to the players’ action. “They’ve become like a political organization and that’s not a good thing,” Trump said. 
The basketball players’ protest began when the Milwaukee Bucks refused to take the court for Game 5 of their playoff series against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday. 
The Bucks players said they were unable to focus on basketball due to demonstrations and violence in Kenosha, which is about 40 miles (60 km) south of Milwaukee. 
The police shooting of Blake reminded Americans of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in May. 
That incident sparked anti-racism demonstrations and civil unrest across the United States and globally as well as prompted a national reckoning on race and justice that has rippled through U.S. life. 
After the player boycott on Wednesday, the NBA postponed all three games on that day’s schedule as well as three playoff games on Thursday. 
The National Hockey League (NHL), which faced social media criticism for not immediately delaying matches too, on Thursday postponed playoff games for that day and Friday. 
“We understand that the tragedies involving Jacob Blake, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others require us to recognize this moment,” the NHL and its players’ association said in a joint statement. 
Several National Football League teams canceled their practices on Thursday, while Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the Women’s National Basketball Association postponed games on Wednesday. The women’s league delayed its Thursday games as well. 
“While our passions continue to run high, we are proud that our players and clubs, League and Union, are taking time to have the difficult conversations about these issues that affect the Black community and other communities of color in America,” the NFL and its players’ association said in a joint statement. 
WHITE HOUSE VS PLAYERS 
The episode highlighted existing animosity between the White House and players. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, told Politico he would contact NBA star LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers about the player protests, and he told CNBC players were lucky to have enough money that they could skip work to protest. 
James, a four-time NBA Most Valuable Player who in 2018 accused Trump of trying to use sports to divide Americans, wrote on Twitter: “Change doesn’t happen with just talk!! It happens with action and needs to happen NOW!” 
Trump said this month that some NBA players are “very nasty” and “frankly very dumb.” In 2018, he said to NFL players who took a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality: “Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.” 
Since the NBA restarted its pandemic-interrupted season, courts have had “Black Lives Matter” painted on them and many players have worn jerseys with social justice slogans. NBA referees marched on Thursday at the Disney campus in support of the players. 
Former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s Democratic challenger in the Nov. 3 presidential election, and his running mate Senator Kamala Harris - the first Black woman on a major-party ticket - praised the actions of the NBA players. 
Kenosha police shot Blake, 29, in the back seven times at close range in an incident captured on video. Blake was left paralyzed by the shooting and is being treated for his injuries.

Trailing in national opinion polls, Trump accepted his party's nomination on the Republican National Convention's final night with a speech asserting that a Biden victory would only worsen the crises besieging the country.

""It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessnesss to your city, to your town, to your suburb,"" said former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a close Trump confidant. Like other Republicans, Giuliani falsely accused Biden of embracing calls to ""defund the police,"" a position the Democrat has rejected.

3779628,0,1,"Sonia Gandhi reaches out to students over NEET, JEE; offers advice to Centre - Hindustan Times","NEET, JEE exams: Ministers of 6 opposition-ruled states move SC seeking review of ‘cryptic’ order","Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday asked the Centre to listen to students and act upon their wishes over holding the Joint Entrance Exams (JEE) and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) next month amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The Congress and other opposition parties have raised their voices against the entrance exams, held for admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and medical colleges across the country, in September. Ministers from six non-BJP-ruled states have filed a review petition before the Supreme Court challenging its August 17 order which had allowed the central government to hold NEET and JEE in September despite the prevailing Covid -19 situation.
“My dear students, I feel for you because you are now facing a very difficult situation. The issue of your exams, of when they should be taken up and where, is the most important issue not only for you but your family too,” Gandhi said in a video message.

“You are our future. We depend on you to build a better India. Therefore, if any decision has to be taken regarding your future, it is important that it is being taken with your concurrence. I hope the government listens to you, listens to your voices and act upon your wishes. This is my advice to the government. Thank you. Jai Hind,” Gandhi said in the message tweeted by her party.
She had held a meeting with the chief ministers of seven states earlier this week over the issue during which West Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee and Punjab’s Amarinder Singh called for moving the Supreme Court.
The ministry of education has said JEE Main and NEET-UG will be conducted in September as scheduled amid a growing chorus for postponing the crucial tests in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. JEE Main is scheduled from September 1-6 and NEET is planned on September 13. Around 8.58 lakh candidates have registered for JEE-Main and 15.97 lakh have registered for NEET.
Before Sonia Gandhi’s message, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urged people to raise their voice against the Centre’s decision to hold the exams next month.
“Unite your voice with lakhs of suffering students. #SpeakUpForStudentSafety from 10am onwards. Let’s make the Govt listen to the students,” Gandhi tweeted in the morning.
The government, on its part, has said that more than 1.7 million candidates have already downloaded their admit cards for JEE and NEET, which shows students want the exams to be conducted.
“National Testing Agency (NTA) officials told me that over seven lakh candidates have downloaded the JEE-Main admit cards while over 10 lakh aspirants have downloaded the NEET admit cards. This shows that the students want the exams to be held at any cost,” Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal “Nishank” said on Thursday.
“We have received mails from students and parents who are in favour of holding the exams, as they have been preparing for the exams for at least two to three years. The Supreme Court too opined that a full academic year cannot be wasted. After two deferments, the exam dates have been finalised,” he added.
The Supreme Court last week dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the two exams amid a spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country, saying a “precious” academic year of students “cannot be wasted” and that life has to go on.
NTA has said it will increase the number of examination centres, put in an alternative seating plan with fewer candidates per room and staggered entry and exit for safely conducting NEET and JEE in September.
The exams have been deferred twice in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The JEE-Mains was originally scheduled to be held from April 7 to April 11 but was postponed to July 18-23. The NEET-UG was originally scheduled for May 3 but was pushed to July 26.","Students follow social distancing as they appear for an exam in Shimla. The petition by the opposition ministers said the top court failed to appreciate that the central government had enough time to ""establish at least one centre for every district for NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains), reported PTI.(Express Photo by Pradeep Kumar)Ministers of six opposition-ruled states Friday moved the Supreme Court seeking review of its order allowing the Centre to conduct NEET and JEE entrance exams this year amid the prevailing coronaviruspandemic situation.
The review plea, filed by ministers from West Bengal (Moloy Ghatak), Jharkhand (Rameshwar Oraon), Rajasthan (Raghu Sharma), Chhattisgarh (Amarjeet Bhagat), Punjab (B S Sidhu) and Maharashtra (Uday Ravindra Sawant), said the apex court order fails to satisfy safety and security concerns of the students who will be appearing for the exams.
In an order on August 17, the top court had dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the NEET and JEE, the medical and engineering entrance exams, scheduled to be held in September, saying that life cannot be stopped and the career of students cannot be put in jeopardy. Are you ready to waste one whole year? If exams are not held, wont it be a loss to the country? Justice Arun Mishra, heading a three-judge bench, had said while hearing the petition.
The apex court had dismissed the plea by one Sayantan Biswas and others seeking direction to National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts both the NEET and JEE exams, to postpone them after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured that all safeguards would be taken.
Terming the decision to go ahead with the exams irrational, the plea by the opposition ministers said the top court failed to appreciate that the central government had enough time to establish at least one centre for every district for NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) rather than having several centres in one district, news agency PTI reported.
The plea further stated that the mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or their willingness or their desire to attend physical exams. It also termed the August 17 order as “cryptic, non-speaking” and said it does not discuss the various aspects and complexities involved in a matter of this magnitude and complex nature.
The plea added that the two reasons given by the court “life must go on and students should not lose an academic year” do not constitute an authoritative and comprehensive judicial scrutiny of the issue.
“It is submitted that if the impugned order dated August 17, 2020 is not reviewed then grave and irreparable harm and injury would befall on the student community of our country and not only will the health, welfare and safety of the students/candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE examinations would stand imperilled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy in these COVID-19 pandemic times,” the petition said.
The review plea also comes two days after Congress chief Sonia Gandhi convened a meeting of opposition chief ministers, in which seven chief ministers decided to approach the Supreme Court seeking postponement of the JEE-NEET examinations in view of the pandemic.

296952,0,1,Explained: Issues in GST compensation,CPI(M) targets government over 'Act of God' remark on GST revenue shortfall,"Written by Aanchal Malhotra | New Delhi | 
Published: August 29, 2020 4:00:19 am
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday referred to the Covid-19 outbreak as an act of God that would result in a contraction of the economy in the current fiscal.
With Centre-state friction over pending compensation payments under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) taking a new turn in the 41st GST Council meeting on Thursday, strain on the finances of states is likely to continue in the near term. Several states have opposed the two options to borrow that were proposed in the meeting as a way to bridge the revenue shortfall.
GST compensation payments to states have been pending since April, with the pending amount for April-July estimated at Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The GST compensation requirement is estimated to be around Rs 3 lakh crore this year, while the cess collection is expected to be around Rs 65,000 crore an estimated compensation shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore.
What was discussed at the meeting?
The legal opinion on borrowing was discussed. The opinion of the Attorney General of India was cited to buttress the argument that GST compensation has to be paid for the transition period from July 2017 to June 2022, but the compensation gap cannot be bridged using the Consolidated Fund of India. The AG has suggested the compensation cess levy can be extended beyond five years to meet the shortfall, Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said.
State Finance Ministers, barring a few including those of Assam and Goa, pressed for borrowing by the Centre to bridge the revenue gap. Towards the end of the meeting, the Centre offered two options.
The first was a special window to states, in consultation with the RBI, to borrow the projected GST shortfall of Rs 97,000 crore, and an amount that can be repaid after five years of GST, ending June 2022, from the compensation cess fund. A 0.5% relaxation in the borrowing limit under The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act would be provided, delinked from the conditions announced earlier as part of the pandemic package linked to the implementation of reform measures such as universalisation of One Nation One Ration Card, ease of doing business, power distribution, and augmentation of urban local body revenues.
The second option was to borrow the entire projected shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore both on account of faltering GST collections and the expected shortfall due to the pandemic facilitated by the RBI. No FRBM relaxation has been mentioned for this option so far.
What are the views of the states on these?
Five states and Union Territories Kerala, Punjab, West Bengal, Puducherry and Delhi have voiced their concerns over the proposals.
KERALA: Finance Minister Thomas Isaac said enforcing a cut in compensation and bringing in a distinction between GST and Covid-related revenue loss is unconstitutional. He has said that the states FRBM limit should be raised by at least 1.5 percentage points if the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore has to be borrowed.
PUNJAB: Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal has said these options were thrust upon the states, and the borrowing would translate into mortgaging of the future to live for the present.
DELHI: Deputy CM Manish Sisodia has said the Centres refusal to pay states is the biggest betrayal in the history of federalism in India, and has expressed concerns about Delhis inability to borrow via the RBI to bridge the compensation gap, given its status of a UT with state legislature.
WEST BENGAL: Finance Minister Amit Mitra said borrowing by states will increase their debt servicing liability, and any other interpretation of the compensation-related Section 18 of The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act is unjustifiable. Section 18 of the amendment says Parliament shall, on the recommendation of the GST Council, provide for compensation to states for the loss of revenue arising out of implementation of the GST for five years.
States have asked the Centre for details of the two options. They will then have seven working days to get back with their views.
What is the significance of GST for states?
States no longer possess taxation rights after most taxes, barring those on petroleum, alcohol, and stamp duty, were subsumed under GST. GST accounts for almost 42% of states own tax revenues, and tax revenues account for around 60% of states total revenues.
Finances of over a dozen states are under severe strain, resulting in delays in salary payments and sharp cuts in capital expenditure outlays amid the pandemic-induced lockdowns and the need to spend on healthcare.
The Finance Secretary said GST collections had been severely impacted by the pandemic. Revenues are expected to be hit further; the economy is projected to record a recession this year. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday referred to the Covid-19 outbreak as an act of God that would result in a contraction of the economy in the current fiscal.
When did the issue of compensation to states arise, and how did it evolve?
Shortfall issues surfaced almost a year ago when payments due for August-September 2019 were delayed. Since then, all subsequent payouts have seen cascading delays.
The economic slowdown, which has been on for almost three years now, began to impact GST revenue collections in August 2019. The Centre first admitted to problems on compensation payment in the 37th GST Council meeting in Goa last September it said the amount of cess available in the compensation fund at the end of February shall fall short for payment of compensation for loss of revenue till the bi-monthly period of December-January.
On November 27, 2019, the GST Council wrote to states that the GST and compensation cess collections in the previous few months had become a matter of concern, and that compensation requirements were unlikely to be met.
GST compensation payments had started getting delayed by then. Many state FMs had begun to express concerns over having to repeatedly ask for their share of revenues. The GST compensation payment of Rs 35,298 crore for August-September 2019, which was due in October, was paid in December. The Centre released another Rs 34,053 crore in two instalments in February 2020 and April 2020 as compensation for October-November 2019.
In June this year, Rs 36,400 crore was released as GST compensation for December-February, and the balance Rs 13,806 crore for March was released in July, taking the total compensation payout for FY20 to Rs 1.65 lakh crore.
Under The GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, states are guaranteed compensation for loss of revenue on account of implementation of GST for a transition period of five years (2017-22). The compensation is calculated based on the difference between the states current GST revenue and the protected revenue after estimating an annualised 14% growth rate from the base year of 2015-16.
The high rate of 14%, which has compounded since 2015-16, has been seen as delinked from economic realities. Chairing the first few meetings of the GST Council, then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had proposed a revenue growth rate of 10.6% (the average all-India growth rate in the three years preceding 2015-16). Council meeting records show the suggestion of 14% revenue growth was accepted in the spirit of compromise.

The Centre on Thursday placed before the GST Council two options for borrowing by states to meet the shortfall in GST revenues pegged at Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the current fiscal. 
Briefing reporters after the 41st meeting of the GST Council, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the economy has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is an 'Act of God', and it will see a contraction in the current fiscal. 
""Central government must borrow if need be and pay the states their legitimate dues. Why should the states borrow? 'Cooperative Federalism'? Having destroyed the Indian Economy now looting the states. Divine intervention?

7433514,0,1,TikTok is said to wrestle with two competing offers,TikTok booms in Southeast Asia as it picks path through political minefields,"By Mike IsaacSAN FRANCISCO: The race to buy TikToks U.S. operations has entered its final stages, with two groups submitting bids for the video app, said three people involved in the deal talks. One of the bids was from Microsoft and Walmart, which have teamed up, and the other was from Oracle and could include a coalition of investors, they said.
The discussions remain fluid, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. It is unclear which group will secure a deal, and the makeup of the bidders could still change.
But TikToks owner, Chinese internet company ByteDance, will most likely make a decision on the competing bids in the coming days, they said. And whichever bid is selected is likely to set TikToks U.S. business down very different paths.
A deal with Microsoft and Walmart could draw on Walmarts digital sales background to turn TikTok into a kind of e-commerce app for both creators and users, people involved in the talks said. That could make TikTok more like Douyin, ByteDances TikTok-like Chinese-language video app, which already has e-commerce integrated into it.
A deal with Oracle, the enterprise software company, would be more of a data play. Oracle could use TikToks data about social interactions to benefit its cloud, data and advertising businesses, the people said.
Representatives for TikTok, Microsoft and Oracle declined to comment. In a statement, Walmart confirmed it was participating in the discussions and said, We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of U.S. TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of U.S. government regulators.
Any deal would cap months of turbulence for TikTok, which has been under intense pressure from the Trump administration. White House officials, who have become increasingly tough on China, have said that TikTok poses a national security threat because it could provide data about U.S. users to Beijing. This month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order mandating that TikTok sell its U.S. operations by mid-September or cease transactions within the country.
That pushed ByteDance and TikTok to seek a buyer, in what could amount to a blockbuster deal. Microsoft had already been talking with TikTok and ByteDance about a potential acquisition, people with knowledge of the talks have said. They initially discussed Microsoft taking just a minority stake in TikTok, before the scope of a deal ballooned.
Since then, Oracle and other bidders have also joined the talks. Bankers and others have also called Netflix, Twitter and others to gauge their interest in doing a deal with TikTok, though the degree of interest has varied widely.
Under stipulations set by the White House to alleviate national security concerns, ByteDance would need to sell TikToks U.S. operations to reduce the apps Chinese ownership. It would also have to sell to one or more companies that have a technology services provider, in part to transfer TikToks American user data over to U.S. servers. Both Microsoft and Oracle satisfy those requirements.
Prices for a potential deal have ranged from $20 billion to $50 billion, people with knowledge of the talks have said. It was unclear what bid amounts were submitted.
Microsoft, with $137 billion in cash and a market value of more than $1.7 trillion, is far larger than other potential acquirers and has the deepest resources. Oracle, with a market value of $175 billion, has roughly $43 billion in cash and short-term investments, and also holds debt.
Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors that the participation of Walmart was likely the final piece of the puzzle that ultimately cements Microsoft successfully acquiring TikToks U.S. operations for likely $35 billion to $40 billion.
The emergence of the two bids follows the resignation late Wednesday of TikToks chief executive, Kevin Mayer. Mayer, a former Disney executive who had announced he was joining TikTok in May, said he was resigning because he had signed on for a global role, not to run a carved-up version of the company. In a note to employees, he also indicated that a deal for TikTok might be close.
We expect to reach a resolution very soon, Mayer wrote.
Zhang Yiming, ByteDances chief executive, said in his own note that ByteDance and TikTok were moving swiftly to resolve its issues in the United States and India, where the app was banned in June.
I cannot get into details at this point, but I can assure you that we are developing solutions that will be in the interest of users, creators, partners and employees, Zhang said.
While Microsofts and Oracles interest in a bid for TikToks U.S. operations has been known, Walmarts participation only emerged Thursday. The worlds largest retailer, known for its brick-and-mortar stores, has recently been pushing into digital businesses like entertainment, partly as a way to outpace its rival Amazon.
The lines are blurring between traditional shopping, digital shopping and social media, said Michael Lasser, a retail analyst for UBS. Connecting with a younger audience is vital to Walmarts long-term outlook, especially as more digitally native generations move into their prime consumption years.
The pandemic has shown the importance of e-commerce to Walmart and other big-box retailers. In an earnings report this month, Walmart said its online sales doubled during the quarter.
Microsoft and Walmart have teamed up before. In 2018, the companies announced a multiyear cloud partnership aimed at accelerating Walmarts digital commerce business.
Oracle, on the other hand, has long been rivals with Microsoft. Both compete to provide software and cloud services to businesses. They have battled over similar contracts, such as the $10 billion technology contract for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, known as JEDI, with the Department of Defense. Microsoft won the contract last year.
In Washington, members of the Trump administration have expressed support for a deal with Oracle. Safra Catz, Oracles chief executive, and Lawrence Ellison, Oracles founder and executive chairman, have close relationships with Trump and other members of the White House, having cultivated those ties for years.
This month, Trump told reporters he would support a TikTok sale to Oracle, which he called a great company.
I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it, Trump said.
Whichever bidder wins the TikTok deal will face the challenges of running a user-generated content business. TikTok has made missteps around content moderation, including an incident in which it suppressed videos from queer, disabled and overweight users. And because TikTok appears to be used by a large number of underage users, any acquirer would have to deal with preventing child exploitative behavior on the platform.","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - At 19, Sandy Saputra is big on TikTok Indonesia. Within a year, he’s leapt from quiet, small-town life to star influencer status as more than 10.5 million followers lap up his toothy grin in dancing, pranking and lip-synching videos on the booming app. 
Sandy’s success, becoming his family’s main breadwinner as global brands like Coca Cola or Suntory pay to have their names on his light-hearted clips, comes as TikTok mushrooms across Southeast Asia. Data trackers show it’s been downloaded hundreds of millions of times already in a region with a collective population of 630 million - half of them under 30. 
But it also comes as concerns over how secure user data is in the hands of its Chinese owner ByteDance summon big storm clouds elsewhere - TikTok has been banned in India and President Donald Trump has ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations, triggering the resignation on Thursday of only recently installed CEO Kevin Mayer. 
Southeast Asia offers a clear view of the global strategy ByteDance is implementing to avoid crackdowns in other regions that influencers like Saputra now fear. The approach is to launch ‘non-political’ products fast, promising to governments in places like Vietnam that content will be tightly policed in accordance with local laws, according to interviews with a dozen current and former employees. 
The region is now key to the future of TikTok and ByteDance: The Chinese firm is already plugging TikTok as part of a suite of interconnected apps for live video streaming, messaging and music, tackling U.S. behemoths Facebook and Google head on as both pour billions into Southeast Asia. 
ByteDance declined to comment for this article, and it’s unclear whether or how the prospective sale of operations in the United States and elsewhere might effect Southeast Asia. But in his base in Sukabumi, West Java province, Saputra is only too aware of risks. 
""Of course I do think about it ... It would be so disappointing if TikTok was erased from Indonesia,"" Saputra told Reuters, speaking before filming a sketch www.tiktok.com/@sandys.ss in a paddy field. 
“It wasn’t planned out. I was an ordinary person, making videos like any other normal person, who didn’t have an idea on how this would play out,” said Saputra, now adding hundreds of thousands of TikTok followers every week. 
SISTER APPS 
In the meantime, TikTok is ploughing ahead testing ‘creator’ marketplaces across the region, championing influencers like Saputra, and negotiating data deals with telecoms firms to keep a lid on consumers’ smartphone bills, according to interviews with current and former staffers. 
It’s chasing small to medium-sized businesses as advertisers - nearly nine out of every 10 firms in Southeast Asia are classified as small - complete with how-to-advertise seminars, millions of dollars in advertising credits, and a self-service platform for businesses to make their own ads. 
TikTok is piloting live-streaming commercial initiatives pioneered in China, Southeast Asia business marketing head Chew Wee Ng said in an interview with Reuters. Meanwhile ByteDance is heavily promoting sister apps like Singapore-headquartered business messaging service Lark and music streaming service Resso. 
“TikTok is really unique in that people expect to see advertisers and they want to co-create with brands,” said Ng, a former Google executive based in Singapore. 
According to data from app analytics firm Sensor Tower, TikTok has had more than 360 millions downloads in Southeast Asia, nearly half of them in Indonesia, with 151% growth year-on-year for 2020. 
An internal ByteDance 2019 presentation reviewed by Reuters showed that last year TikTok had 43.5 million monthly active users in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, with the majority female, the biggest online consumers in the region. 
The app grew staggeringly fast in recent months, sources said, as lockdowns enforced across the region to tackle the coronavirus pandemic forced people to stay home. In Indonesia, Saputra said he’s been acquiring 100,000 followers every three days. 
LOCAL MODERATORS 
With growth has come increased government scrutiny, but ByteDance has already had plenty of experience dealing with that. As on other business matters, ByteDance declined to comment on its handling of scrutiny. 
Indonesia presented one of its first major global policy challenges in 2018, after authorities briefly banned TikTok for posts they said contained “pornography, inappropriate content and blasphemy”. 
Within 24 hours, the firm had dispatched senior executives to negotiate with Indonesia, promising to raise the age of its users and to hire a team of local moderators, according to sources and to the-then Indonesian communications minister. 
It would quickly copy this approach by installing moderators across its Southeast Asian markets in a bid to insure compliance with local laws. 
Reuters reported in August that from 2018 until 2020, ByteDance censored content that it perceived as critical of the Chinese government on a news aggregator app in Indonesia known as BaBe at the behest of ByteDance’s China headquarters. 
As of August 2020, most of the content guidelines have been localised for individual Southeast Asian countries. That has often meant strict censorship of local political content. 
In Thailand, where a youth protest movement is challenging the country’s monarchy, some users told Reuters their pro-protest videos had been taken down. [L4N2FK2IX] 
‘IN VIETNAM, CHINA IS POLITICAL’ 
In Vietnam, TikTok has blocked most political content for years, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company declined to comment. 
Hanoi has been in a long-running conflict with U.S. tech giants over demands to restrict any content deemed against the state and create local offices in Vietnam. 
Reuters reported in April that Facebook agreed to increase censorship of “anti-state” posts in Vietnam after its local servers were temporarily taken off-line. [L3N2CA1L0] 
ByteDance, which unlike big U.S. tech players does have an office in the country, decided to pre-empt issues with the government by promising to make its app ‘non-political’. 
Due to Vietnam’s contentious relationship with China, ByteDance decided it would also ban content critical of Beijing, and anything related to tensions between the two governments. 
“In Vietnam, China is political,” one source said. 
The approach has been effective. TikTok now counts Vietnam, a multi-billion dollar market for social media firms, as among its most profitable in Asia, according to sources with knowledge of the matter, while launching regular campaigns with authorities on safety and tourism. 
Back in West Java, Sandy Saputra aims to keep on flashing grins and goofing around on TikTok. 
“To me, this isn’t a job,” he said, before breaking away into another dance routine. “It’s a hobby that makes money.”

The plea said that as per NTA, approximately 9.53 lakh and 15.97 lakh students have registered for JEE (Mains) and NEET (UG), respectively. This means 25 lakh students cumulatively would be appearing for these two examinations, the petition stated. As on 27th August, India has over 3.31 million [more than 33 lakh] Covid-19 cases. We are presently at the third position in this unenviable list after the US (5.79 million cases) and Brazil (3.72 million) and on course to be the No. 1 nation on this list.
While there are 660 examination centres for JEE roughly 1,443 students per centre there are 3,843 centres for NEET, or approximately 415 students per centre, the petitioners pointed out. Such large movement of people will ipso facto prove to be a serious health hazard and will totally defeat the twin present-day solutions we have of combating the Covid-19 i.e. social distancing and avoidance of large public gatherings, they said, urging the court to postpone the entrance examinations.

The plea said, Having at least one centre per district would have minimised the inter-district travel of students and thereby reduced chances of Covid-19 spread.
The petitioners said, The mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or willingness or desire to attend physical exams, as no student would like to forego the exam, if its conducted and the respondents are forcing the students to put their lives and health in peril by conducting these exams.
In a situation, the plea said, where there is absolutely no classroom teaching, the decision of the Union Government to conduct examinations on such a massive scale reveals non-application of mind and is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious exercise of power.
The petitioners said they do not wish to make any value judgment or political criticism of the Union Government in such times but the undisputed facts are that there has been an exponential increase in both Covid-19 positive cases as well as deaths/mortality arising out of Covid-19 from April, when these exams were originally scheduled, till August, when the Union Government decided to conduct the said examinations.
The Covid-19 graph is showing a continuous upward movement and the ‘curve’ has not flattened for the Government to undertake such a massive exercise, the petition stated. It said that schools and colleges continue to remain shut despite the various phases of unlock and there is no rational nexus between the object of the examinations and the purpose that it seeks to achieve.

The six ministers stated that the Centre had adequate time to make comprehensive preparations for safe and successful conduct of the examinations. However, they argued, the intervening months from April to September were characterised by inaction, confusion, lethargy and inertia…now the Union Government has suddenly woken up to realise that their inertia is going to cost lakhs of students their academic year and therefore as a knee-jerk reaction…has haphazardly and hurriedly fixed the dates of the examinations.
The petitioners called it a remedy that will prove to be worse than the disease itself.
The plea said that postponing the exams by two months would give valuable time to the government to put in place an adequate mechanism in consultation with the State Governments, to ensure a smoother and safer conduct of examinations.
The petition also pointed to health issues of students and said that even otherwise, with recent evidences and information of the virus being allegedly airborne now, conducting of physical examination of such magnitude can have disastrous consequences.

The petition said there have been instances where surge in cases have been reported after offline exams were conducted.
The process of reaching the examination centre itself can be a major source of contracting the infection, and candidates may become vectors carrying the virus to their homes, it said.
The petitioners said, The mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or willingness or desire to attend physical exams, as no student would like to forego the exam, if its conducted and the respondents are forcing the students to put their lives and health in peril by conducting these exams.
They said, If the Union Govt/NTA decides to hold the exams, then the students do not have an effective choice left but to register and appear for the exam at great personal risk.

2503775,0,1,"Walmart wants to go viral with TikTok, Wall Street thinks it can",TikTok is said to wrestle with two competing offers,"(Reuters) - Wall Street was swift to see the rationale behind Walmart Inc jumping into the fray to buy TikTok - access to millions of young, digitally savvy users who could help the 60-year-old company boost its online sales. 
The retailer revealed plans to join Microsoft Corp in a bid for the social media firm’s U.S. assets on Thursday, hours after the video company’s chief executive said he would step down. 
Analysts said Walmart picking up a stake in the short-form video app, which is owned by China’s ByteDance and claims to have about 100 million active monthly users in the United States, could be a game changer for the world’s largest retailer. 
“Connecting with a younger audience is vital to Walmart’s long-term outlook, especially as more digitally native generations move into their prime consumption years,” UBS analyst Michael Lasser said. 
“The lines are blurring between traditional shopping, digital shopping and social media. Walmart needs more exposure to this trend.” 
Companies have been scrambling to advertise and sell on apps like TikTok and Facebook’s Instagram, where shopping has surged, as people spend hours everyday scrolling through the latest viral videos from their favorite influencers. 
About 23% of U.S. users reported making a purchase on Instagram earlier this year, compared to just 15% in late-2019, according to a survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets. 
A combination of Walmart’s e-commerce operations and customer purchase data with Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform and TikTok’s mostly millennial and Gen Z monthly users could create a digital behemoth even more dominant than Amazon.com Inc or Facebook, Jefferies analyst Christopher Mandeville said. 
However, any potential deal will come under intense regulatory scrutiny, with TikTok under fire from the White House as a potential national security risk. 
Oracle Corp has also bid for TikTok’s U.S. operations. 
Twitter livened up with memes after Walmart announced it had teamed up with Microsoft to buy a social media app less than three-years old. 
“Walmart and Microsoft buying Tiktok easily the most ‘hello fellow kids’ move of all time,” Twitter user @ericzawo said. 
Reporting by Uday Sampath and Aniruddha Ghosh in Bengaluru; Editing by Sweta Singh and Sriraj Kalluvila","By Mike IsaacSAN FRANCISCO: The race to buy TikToks U.S. operations has entered its final stages, with two groups submitting bids for the video app, said three people involved in the deal talks. One of the bids was from Microsoft and Walmart, which have teamed up, and the other was from Oracle and could include a coalition of investors, they said.
The discussions remain fluid, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. It is unclear which group will secure a deal, and the makeup of the bidders could still change.
But TikToks owner, Chinese internet company ByteDance, will most likely make a decision on the competing bids in the coming days, they said. And whichever bid is selected is likely to set TikToks U.S. business down very different paths.
A deal with Microsoft and Walmart could draw on Walmarts digital sales background to turn TikTok into a kind of e-commerce app for both creators and users, people involved in the talks said. That could make TikTok more like Douyin, ByteDances TikTok-like Chinese-language video app, which already has e-commerce integrated into it.
A deal with Oracle, the enterprise software company, would be more of a data play. Oracle could use TikToks data about social interactions to benefit its cloud, data and advertising businesses, the people said.
Representatives for TikTok, Microsoft and Oracle declined to comment. In a statement, Walmart confirmed it was participating in the discussions and said, We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of U.S. TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of U.S. government regulators.
Any deal would cap months of turbulence for TikTok, which has been under intense pressure from the Trump administration. White House officials, who have become increasingly tough on China, have said that TikTok poses a national security threat because it could provide data about U.S. users to Beijing. This month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order mandating that TikTok sell its U.S. operations by mid-September or cease transactions within the country.
That pushed ByteDance and TikTok to seek a buyer, in what could amount to a blockbuster deal. Microsoft had already been talking with TikTok and ByteDance about a potential acquisition, people with knowledge of the talks have said. They initially discussed Microsoft taking just a minority stake in TikTok, before the scope of a deal ballooned.
Since then, Oracle and other bidders have also joined the talks. Bankers and others have also called Netflix, Twitter and others to gauge their interest in doing a deal with TikTok, though the degree of interest has varied widely.
Under stipulations set by the White House to alleviate national security concerns, ByteDance would need to sell TikToks U.S. operations to reduce the apps Chinese ownership. It would also have to sell to one or more companies that have a technology services provider, in part to transfer TikToks American user data over to U.S. servers. Both Microsoft and Oracle satisfy those requirements.
Prices for a potential deal have ranged from $20 billion to $50 billion, people with knowledge of the talks have said. It was unclear what bid amounts were submitted.
Microsoft, with $137 billion in cash and a market value of more than $1.7 trillion, is far larger than other potential acquirers and has the deepest resources. Oracle, with a market value of $175 billion, has roughly $43 billion in cash and short-term investments, and also holds debt.
Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors that the participation of Walmart was likely the final piece of the puzzle that ultimately cements Microsoft successfully acquiring TikToks U.S. operations for likely $35 billion to $40 billion.
The emergence of the two bids follows the resignation late Wednesday of TikToks chief executive, Kevin Mayer. Mayer, a former Disney executive who had announced he was joining TikTok in May, said he was resigning because he had signed on for a global role, not to run a carved-up version of the company. In a note to employees, he also indicated that a deal for TikTok might be close.
We expect to reach a resolution very soon, Mayer wrote.
Zhang Yiming, ByteDances chief executive, said in his own note that ByteDance and TikTok were moving swiftly to resolve its issues in the United States and India, where the app was banned in June.
I cannot get into details at this point, but I can assure you that we are developing solutions that will be in the interest of users, creators, partners and employees, Zhang said.
While Microsofts and Oracles interest in a bid for TikToks U.S. operations has been known, Walmarts participation only emerged Thursday. The worlds largest retailer, known for its brick-and-mortar stores, has recently been pushing into digital businesses like entertainment, partly as a way to outpace its rival Amazon.
The lines are blurring between traditional shopping, digital shopping and social media, said Michael Lasser, a retail analyst for UBS. Connecting with a younger audience is vital to Walmarts long-term outlook, especially as more digitally native generations move into their prime consumption years.
The pandemic has shown the importance of e-commerce to Walmart and other big-box retailers. In an earnings report this month, Walmart said its online sales doubled during the quarter.
Microsoft and Walmart have teamed up before. In 2018, the companies announced a multiyear cloud partnership aimed at accelerating Walmarts digital commerce business.
Oracle, on the other hand, has long been rivals with Microsoft. Both compete to provide software and cloud services to businesses. They have battled over similar contracts, such as the $10 billion technology contract for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, known as JEDI, with the Department of Defense. Microsoft won the contract last year.
In Washington, members of the Trump administration have expressed support for a deal with Oracle. Safra Catz, Oracles chief executive, and Lawrence Ellison, Oracles founder and executive chairman, have close relationships with Trump and other members of the White House, having cultivated those ties for years.
This month, Trump told reporters he would support a TikTok sale to Oracle, which he called a great company.
I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it, Trump said.
Whichever bidder wins the TikTok deal will face the challenges of running a user-generated content business. TikTok has made missteps around content moderation, including an incident in which it suppressed videos from queer, disabled and overweight users. And because TikTok appears to be used by a large number of underage users, any acquirer would have to deal with preventing child exploitative behavior on the platform.",https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN25O28F-OCATC,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/tiktok-is-said-to-wrestle-with-two-competing-offers/articleshow/77796914.cms
6314063,0,1,TikTok’s founder wonders what hit him - Livemint,TikTok is said to wrestle with two competing offers,"Zhang Yiming was having breakfast at home in Beijing in July when a message popped on his computer screen. A friend sent a link featuring President Trump, in which he said the coronavirus came from China and, as part of a U.S. response, he might ban TikTok, the hit video app Mr. Zhang founded.Mr. Zhang was astonished. China virus?"" he told people around him later. What did the coronavirus have to do with TikTok?
From that initial shock, things quickly got worse.
First, Mr. Trump upped the stakes by ordering that TikToks parent company sell the apps American operation or face a U.S. ban, on grounds it threatens national security through the data it gathers.
Next, as Chinese nationalists lashed out at Mr. Zhang on social media for not fighting the Trump order, Mr. Zhangs heavy-hitting Western investors were applying pressure on him to do the oppositeheed the order and sell.
Mr. Zhang fired back at Mr. Trump on Monday with a lawsuit filed in federal court in California to stop the White House order. Then, he suddenly lost the high-profile lieutenant he had hired to extend TikToks globalization. Kevin Mayer, brought in barely three months ago from Walt Disney Co., announced Thursday he was quitting as TikTok CEO because the political circumstances had changed his role so much.
Thus has the Chinese founder of an app for teens, filled with goofy dancing and lip-synching videos, been dragged into the tense U.S.-China geopolitical relationship. Mr. Zhang, a 37-year-old admirer of Silicon Valley, always wanted the company he created to be seen as global. But not this way.
Thanks to the specter of a ban on TikToks U.S. business unless its sold, the apps lucrative American operation is in play, with Microsoft Corp., Twitter Inc. and Oracle Corp. all negotiating to buy it or exploring a bid.
An ultimatum from the White House was decidedly not the future Mr. Zhang imagined as a young, entrepreneurial-minded software engineer in China.
He is different from an earlier generation of Chinese tech-company founders who sought favor from Chinas ruling Communist Party establishment. Mr. Zhang skews more California than Great Hall of the People. He wears a T-shirt and jeans, eats at the company cafeteria and cites tech mottos such as Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezoss Always Day 1"" rule that a company should never stop acting like a startup.
Employees of the TikTok parent company, ByteDance Ltd., which Mr. Zhang founded, refer to him by his given name, Yiming. He isnt a Communist Party member.
Born in the southeastern province of Fujian in 1983, a period when China was starting to open up, Mr. Zhang studied software engineering at a university in the northern city of Tianjin, where he met his wife and gained a reputation as a guy who could fix computers. He worked at various startups and had a brief stint in corporate life, joining Microsofts Beijing office as an engineer in 2008.
He stayed less than a year at Microsoft, telling Chinese media he found the work so unchallenging that he spent half his time reading books.
China in those years was fortifying its control of the internet, and after riots in the restive far-western region of Xinjiang in 2009, authorities blocked several websites on grounds the unrest had been organized online. Mr. Zhang, by then working for a Chinese Twitter clone called Fanfou, rallied against the restrictions.
Go out and wear a T-shirt supporting Google,"" he wrote in a blog post. If you block the internet, Ill write what I want to say on my clothes.""
The blog is no longer accessible online. Google pulled its search-engine operations from mainland China a year later.
Mr. Zhang started ByteDance, TikToks parent, in a Beijing apartment in 2012. From the start it had global ambitions, though many employees had never been abroad. The biggest meeting room was about 10 square meters, but your ideas could be very big,"" Mr. Zhang reminisced last year in an anniversary video.
One of its first products was a news-aggregation app called Jinri Toutiao, or Todays Headlines."" Mr. Zhang, who is ByteDances CEO as well as founder, didnt have a media background, but he could code. The app used artificial intelligence to feed people news based on their reading habits: What did they tend to click on? How long did they linger? Did they finish the article?
It also received more than 100 lawsuits and complaints from other online news portals and from newspapers, some accusing it of swiping their content. In some cases, ByteDance had to compensate content creators for using their work without permission. ByteDance said the company faced some confusion"" about copyright laws in China in its early years and has since formed partnerships with many media sites.
A trip to California in 2014 solidified Mr. Zhangs resolve to build a global company. With a group of other young Chinese business founders, he toured Facebook Inc. and Tesla Motors Inc. and met figures such as Yahoo Inc. co-founder Jerry Yang. He left convinced that Chinese tech entrepreneurs could compete in the big leagues.
TikTok proved him right. Powered by algorithms that can make its video feed addictive, it became a global sensation. TikTok has been downloaded more than two billion times world-wide, according to market research firm Sensor Tower. Its still-private parent ByteDance has a $100 billion valuation.
Besides being the first consumer app from China to make it big in the West, TikTok, unlike many of Chinas past successes, cant be accused of copying Western technology rather than innovating.
TikTok now is the primary social-media platform for millions of teenagers around the world. An entrepreneur doesnt have a country. When they develop something, its just not for any particular market, its for people globally,"" said Anis Uzzaman, founder of investor Pegasus Tech Ventures.
Although technology was once seen as a sector where the U.S and China could work togetherAmerican venture capitalists fueled Chinas startups and Chinese engineers moved into Silicon Valleyit is instead emerging as a front line in the superpowers standoff. TikTok has landed at the center of the tussle, along with Huawei Technologies Co. and Tencent Holdings WeChat messaging and payment app, which also faces an impending ban in the U.S. imposed by the Trump administration.
TikTok will increasingly be seen by Chinese authorities as a strategically important company, said Ian Bremmer, president of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. Its importance lies in the immense quantity of user data it collects, which drives deep learning"" and AI, he said.
China suddenly realizes they need these tech capabilities internally, and they need them fast,"" Mr. Bremmer said.
ByteDance launched TikTok in 2017, then acquired a Shanghai-based rival, Musical.ly, that was gaining traction among American teens, and folded it into TikTok. Mr. Zhang told a forum at Beijings Tsinghua University in March 2018 that he expected TikTok to have more users outside of China than inside it within three years.
A few weeks after that forum, the Chinese government shut down a ByteDance joke-sharing app for publishing vulgar"" content.
This time, rather than denounce censorship, Mr. Zhang responded with a lengthy social-media post apologizing and promising to nearly double the number of censors at the company. Asked about that this week, a ByteDance spokesman said the apology was an explanation to users upset that Mr. Zhang hadnt protected the platform from content that didnt match their values.
As TikTok expanded abroad, its young workforce struggled to navigate regulatory minefields. Authorities in the U.S., the Netherlands and France began scrutinizing its practices surrounding the protection of user data. In June, TikTok was among Chinese apps banned in India, TikToks biggest market by downloads, on cybersecurity grounds. South Koreas telecom regulator fined TikTok in July for mishandling the data of users under 14.
A Wall Street Journal analysis found this month that for more than a year, the app tracked users using a tactic banned by Google, which enabled it to collect unique identifiers from millions of mobile devices without letting users opt out.
TikTok says it no longer does this and has promised to create a firewall between China and overseas users.
The Trump administration worries about potential Chinese government access to TikToks user data. Chinas national-security law obliges Chinese companies to assist in investigations related to national security. This means, according to Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, an independent research organization, that ByteDance would be likely to have some trouble pushing back against certain data requests from authorities in Beijing.
ByteDance says it doesnt share data with the Chinese government and wouldnt do so if asked.
Late last year, as the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States began a review of ByteDance and TikTok practices to be sure they dont pose a national-security risk, Mr. Zhang reached out to Microsoft President Brad Smith and CEO Satya Nadella for advice on how to address data-security concerns and earn the trust of regulators, according to people privy to Mr. Zhangs thinking.
The people said this resulted in plans by TikTok to open a center in Los Angeles aimed at providing more transparency to outsiders about the apps operations. The talks eventually evolved into discussions of a sale, the people said.
Mr. Zhang read a book by Mr. Smith on tech-company governance, Tools and Weapons,"" and had it translated into Chinese. He ordered his ByteDance management team to read it, said a person familiar with the matter.
In one corporate chat conversation, Mr. Zhang highlighted an excerpt from the book about the 2019 mosque massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, which the shooter live-streamed on the internet, leading to criticism of social-media companies. He urged his staff to test ByteDances ability to respond to such a situation, according to a screenshot of the chat seen by the Journal.
Mr. Zhang, who last year spent much of his time jet-setting, is now stuck in China because of the coronavirus. He is keeping U.S. hours, often in meetings with investors across the Pacific about the fate of his company.
As he faces pressure from investors to agree to a sale of TikToks U.S. business to satisfy Mr. Trumpthe president has said the U.S. Treasury should get part of the sale priceMr. Zhang has held out hope for a different solution. He is growing increasingly isolated in the talks, one person said.
Lately, he has come around to the idea that a sale is inevitable, people familiar with the matter say. ByteDance declined to comment on the status of the talks.
In a letter to employees earlier this month, Mr. Zhang advised forbearance. There has been a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment in many countries,"" he wrote. Dont mind any short-term praise or loss, and patiently do the right thing.""

3198267,0,1,"Trump accepts nomination, calls Biden 'destroyer of American greatness'","Republican convention praise of Trump economy is risky strategy, poll highlights - Reuters","US President Donald Trump castigated his Democratic rival Joe Biden as ""the destroyer of American greatness"" and assured voters that he will end the raging coronavirus pandemic that has ravaged the economy and quell the civil unrest, as he accepted the Republican nomination for a second term in office.
""This election will decide whether we save the American dream"" or whether ""we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny,"" Trump, 74, said on Thursday amidst cheers from some 1,500 ardent supporters who were mostly maskless.
My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States,"" he said in his 70-minute address from the South Lawn of the White House as hundreds of protesters staged a noisy demonstration outside against his policies.
I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years, Trump said.
In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity! he said.
""We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before,"" he told the Americans as the country has witnessed over 180,000 deaths and over five million COVID-19 infections, making the the US the worst-hit nation.
Party's delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Trump and Pence are being challenged in the November 3 elections by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris.
Trump slammed Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness.
""He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness.""
Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history, Trump said.
The president said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered.
This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas, he said.
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens.
And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it, he said.
""Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism,"" he said.
Trump also referred to violent racial justice protests that have swept the nation in recent months following the killings of Black Americans.
The president said the Democrats at their party convention last week had disparaged America as a place of racial, social and economic injustice.
""So tonight I ask you a very simple question - how can the Democrat party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?
""In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins,"" Trump said.
Attacking his opponent's decades-long political life, Trump said: ""Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars.""
China, Trump said, would ""own our country"" if Biden wins and that only he would hold Beijing accountable for the ""tragedy they caused"" over the COVID-19.
Meanwhile, in an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump's acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party.
Earlier, Trump was introduced by one of his daughters, Ivanka, who said her father did not come to Washington to win praise from the Beltway elites, but to ""make America great again"".
""Washington has not changed Donald Trump.Donald Trump has changed Washington,"" she said.
Biden's running mate, Harris, delivered a speech hours before the president spoke, declaring: ""Donald Trump doesn't understand the presidency.""
""Donald Trump has failed at the most basic and important job of a president of the United States: he failed to protect the American people, plain and simple,"" the Indian-American senator said.
(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans’ support for President Donald Trump’s management of the economy has slipped, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows, challenging a bedrock re-election argument laid out at the Republican National Convention this week. 
About 58% of respondents said the U.S. economy is on the wrong track in a survey taken August 19 through 25th. 
And for the first time this year, Trump’s net approval on economic issues dipped into negative territory, with 47% saying they approved of his stewardship of the American economy and 48% saying they disapproved. That is down from an approval margin of 14 percentage points in late March. 
While the poll shows Trump still has an edge with voters over Democratic opponent Joe Biden on the economy, the results highlight the risks the Republican Party is taking by leaning on memories of last year’s strong economy and arguing that Trump will easily be able to restore it. 
“Our economic choice is very clear. Do you want economic health, prosperity, opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation, recession and pessimism?” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said at the convention on Tuesday night. 
“Who do you trust to rebuild this economy?,” Vice President Mike Pence asked Wednesday night. “A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world?” 
BOUNCE AHEAD, BUT THEN WHAT? 
Looking to the fall, just as the U.S. witnessed a historic drop here in gross domestic product from April through June, Trump will be able to trumpet a record increase - equivalent to perhaps 25% on an annualized basis - when statistics are released in October covering the July to September period. 
Neither data point, products of a deliberate shutdown of the economy in March and the automatic impact of reopening from that sudden stop, say much about the economic fortunes of families and businesses during the first months of the pandemic, or in the weeks to come. 
The coronavirus health crisis, with nearly 6 million infected and over 175,000 Americans dead, is still raging. The onset of the conventional flu season is on the horizon, and an experiment underway in reopening schools and colleges is already leading to new spikes in infections. 
Consumer confidence, which can influence future economic activity, remains weak. The national unemployment rate at 10.2% in July is the highest in 39 years, and improvement seems to be slowing. Nearly 15 million Americans are receiving unemployment benefits, the highest on record and double the number hit during the 2007 to 2009 Great Recession. 
The blow has been received hardest among groups including blacks, Hispanics and women who benefited most from last year’s record low unemployment rate. Continued support among white women in particular will be critical to Trump’s electoral chances. 
TRUMP EDGE OVER BIDEN 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll found most voters would not currently back Biden on the economy. 
Trump’s team has been hammering Biden’s discussion of tax policies to pay for rising government debt due to the Trump administration’s earlier tax cuts. 
Among registered voters, Trump still has a five-point edge over Biden in who would be better to manage the economy. 
But the poll also found 30% of Republicans felt the economy was on the wrong track, the highest since February 2018 when Reuters/Ipsos started tracking the question. 
The poll gathered responses from 4,428 American adults, including 1,929 Democrats, 1,750 Republicans and 430 independents. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of between 2-5 percentage points. 
If the economic impact of the pandemic has been in some ways less severe than feared, with household spending returning to pre-pandemic levels and Americans boosting their savings, it is only because of massive government spending and a larger federal footprint in the economy. 
Both Republican and Democratic leaning economists feel much more federal help and a larger federal footprint will be needed to avoid a deeper slide this fall - steps that Trump would have to embrace even as he tries to brand Biden a “socialist.” 
The lapse of $600 a week unemployment benefits, the expiration of loans for small businesses, and the lack of help for state and local governments may in short order pull the rug from economic data that has been more positive than expected since a wave of business lockdowns and social distancing measures in April. 
A Census survey in July said reported “food insecurity” rose more than 20% early in the pandemic, reaching nearly 30 million. 
As former Fed chair Janet Yellen and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities senior adviser Jared Bernstein said in a New York Times column, a lot more people are hungry. 
Both have been briefing Biden on economic issues, and wrote that without further federal spending, “millions of needy Americans will suffer and the overall economy could degrade from its current slow rebound in growth to no growth at all.”

2499404,0,1,"‘He doesn’t understand presidency’: Biden, Harris hit back at Trump - Hindustan Times","Trump accepts nomination, calls Biden 'destroyer of American greatness'","Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for US president, countered President Donald Trump’s attacks on him from the convention with a string of tweets, pointing out the mushrooming Covid-19 cases and infections across the country. Biden held President Trump responsible for the protests that he sought to portray as lawlessness.
Kamala Harris, Biden’s vice-presidential nominee, had laid out a more detailed critique of the president’s handling of the Covid-19 epidemic and his response to the anti-racism protest in a prebuttal. She argued, “Trump doesn’t understand the presidency”.
“Remember: every example of violence Donald Trump decries has happened on his watch. Under his leadership. During his presidency,” Biden shot back in a tweet, to Trump’s portrayal of them as harbingers of the kind of lawlessness and chaos that will take place on Biden’s watch.

Trump has tried to position himself as a law-and-order president has used the anti-race protests to stoke fears about lawlessnesses tying them to the radical left-wing of the Democratic party, who he has argued, will be calling the shots in a Biden administration.
In his counter-attack, Biden sought to keep the focus on Trump’s key vulnerability - the Covid-19 epidemic which has killed close to 180,000 Americans and infected 6 million.
“From the moment COVID-19 emerged, President Trump downplayed the threat it posed, refused to listen to the experts, and failed to take action to contain its spread.,” he wrote in one tweet. “Now, we’re paying the price”.
In prepared remarks for the prebuttal, Harris said, Trump had displayed “reckless disregard for the danger a pandemic would pose to American lives. For the devastation, it would do to our economy. For the damage, it would do to communities of colour who have been subjected to structural racism for generations”.
“He never appreciated that a President swears an oath before God and country to protect America against threats seen and unseen. It’s his duty. It’s his obligation to protect us.

4742304,0,1,NBA star LeBron James emerges as potent political force ahead of November U.S. election,"US Election 2020: Donald Trump to attack Joe Biden as US confronts coronavirus, anti-racism protests","(Reuters) - Two years after a conservative commentator told LeBron James to “shut up and dribble,” the NBA star has become an increasingly influential political force as issues of racial justice and voter suppression move to the forefront in the November presidential election. 
James, an outspoken activist and frequent critic of President Donald Trump, helped form a group that will spend millions of dollars to battle voter disenfranchisement in predominantly Black communities ahead of the Nov. 3 election between the Republican Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. 
He also has helped push the NBA to recognize racial justice issues and the Black Lives Matter movement, including the decision to postpone playoff games this week after a player boycott to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by police in Wisconsin. 
That prompted Trump to denounce the league on Thursday, saying it was “like a political organization.” 
James, who campaigned for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016, has promised to campaign for Biden this year. His influence could be critical in 2020, strategists and activists said, given the party’s need to bolster Black voter turnout, which saw its first drop in 20 years in 2016. 
“LeBron is likely to have a huge impact,” said Karen Finney, a Democratic political strategist and aide on Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “He has the respect and the credibility with the Black community, so he’s a tremendous asset.” 
James’ longtime activism on racial justice issues and criticism of Trump prompted white Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham in 2018 to tell him and fellow Black NBA star Kevin Durant to “shut up and dribble.” 
This week, James, 35, a 16-time NBA All Star who is considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time, reacted angrily to the shooting on Sunday of Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which sparked days of civil unrest. 
The incident recalled the police killing of another Black man, George Floyd, in Minnesota in May that sparked anti-racism demonstrations in many U.S. cities. Blake’s shooting reverberated through U.S. professional sports, with leagues postponing games and practices. 
“WE DEMAND CHANGE. SICK OF IT,” tweeted James, whose Los Angeles Lakers are vying for the National Basketball Association title. 
James’ leadership on the issue got the attention of the White House, with adviser Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, saying in a televised interview on Thursday that he would reach out to James to see what both sides could work on together. 
Biden said on Thursday he was arranging a call with the NBA after it reached out to discuss the boycotts. He did not elaborate, and a spokesman for his campaign declined to do so as well. 
TRUSTED VOICES 
James formed the voting rights group More Than a Vote earlier this year along with other prominent athletes to counter misinformation and fight what he said was voter suppression in Black communities. 
“LeBron recognized that these athletes are the most trusted members of their communities,” said a person familiar with his thinking. “It is entirely about the Black community and protecting and strengthening their right to vote.” 
The group will collaborate with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund on a multimillion-dollar initiative to recruit young poll workers in Black communities in a dozen states, including battlegrounds such as Michigan, Florida, Wisconsin and Georgia. 
A shortage of poll workers to staff in-person voting sites amid worries about the coronavirus pandemic led to dramatically fewer polling locations in some states that held primaries earlier this year, including Georgia and Wisconsin. 
That led to long lines, hours-long waits and widespread confusion, particularly in hard-hit African-American communities that felt the brunt of the cutbacks. 
The group previously partnered with teams in Los Angeles and Atlanta to turn stadiums into polling places, and worked on an effort to help the formerly incarcerated restore their voting rights in Florida. 
Amy Koch, a Republican strategist who lives in Minneapolis, where Floyd’s death sparked the first wave of protests, said James’ voice would have an impact but carried some risk of alienating suburban voters who have grown frustrated and are not differentiating between peaceful protests and violent ones. 
“If he can get some of that extra vote out, he will make a difference,” she said. “The difference between him and some other celebrities is he doesn’t wade into everything, so he has credibility and he’s disciplined.” 
Donna Brazile, a former Democratic National Committee chairwoman and the campaign manager for presidential candidate Al Gore in 2000, said James and other athletes were using their celebrity to draw attention to the inequities of the justice system. 
“What they’re saying to their fan base is if you want change, you’re going to have to vote for change,” she said. “If you want to fix the problem, you’re going to have to put people in office who can change the policies.” 
Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt in New York and Jarrett Renshaw in Pennsylvania; Writing by John Whitesides; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Peter Cooney","President Donald Trump prepared to attack Democratic rival Joe Biden in front of a large crowd on the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday, as the United States struggles to address the coronavirus pandemic and a wave of anti-racism protests.
Trailing in national opinion polls less than 10 weeks before the Nov. 3 election, Trump will accept his party's nomination on the Republican National Convention's final night with a speech asserting that a Biden victory would only worsen the crises besieging the country.
""At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" Trump was expected to say, according to excerpts provided to Reuters ahead of the evening.
""We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years,"" he would say, referring to Biden's career as a U.S. senator and vice president.
Though an incumbent seeking a second four-year term, Trump remains a self-styled outsider, an approach that won him the White House, his first elected office, in 2016 on a promise to end the crime and violence he said was afflicting the country.
His convention's first three nights focused heavily on trying to convince Americans that Democrats, not the Trump administration, are to blame for the racial strife convulsing U.S. cities. Several speakers accused Biden of wanting to defund the police, even though he has rejected that position.
At a fundraiser on Thursday, Biden, 77, said Trump, 74 had used the specter of violence as a ""political strategy,"" rather than actually aiming to address it. Democrats formally nominated Biden at a convention last week.
""Donald Trump keeps saying it won't be safe in Joe Biden's America,"" he said. ""Their proof? The violence you're seeing is in Donald Trump's administration, Donald Trump's America. Did they forget who's president?""
Trump's decision to speak from the White House lawn to an expected crowd of more than 1,000 has drawn criticism that he is using the official residence for partisan purposes and ignoring the risk of coronavirus transmission.
Hours before Trump's speech, a large crowd assembled in white chairs, with little evidence of social distancing or face masks, despite health experts' recommendations. The coronavirus prompted both political parties to scale back their conventions and make events mostly virtual.
The Trump campaign said it had taken appropriate health precautions.
About 300 anti-Trump protesters gathered on Black Lives Matter Plaza nearby, playing music and dancing ahead of Trump's speech.
NATION UNDER SIEGE
More than 180,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus - more than any other country, according to a Reuters tally - amid a fresh wave of protests over the latest high-profile police shooting of a Black American.
In Kenosha, Wisconsin, relative calm returned after three nights of civil strife ending on Tuesday - including arson, vandalism and deadly shootings - sparked by a police shooting that paralyzed a Black man.
Trump, a former New York real estate developer, is seeking to turn around a re-election campaign that has been largely overshadowed by a health crisis that has put millions of Americans out of work.
While his approval rating among Republican voters remains high, dissent is mounting within the party. In three open letters being published on Thursday and Friday, Biden won endorsements from more than 160 people who worked for Republican former President George W. Bush or for past Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, the New York Times and Politico reported.
Earlier this week, 27 former Republican lawmakers endorsed Biden while the Lincoln Project, among the most prominent Republican-backed groups opposing Trump, said a former Republican Party head had joined it as a senior adviser.
Thursday's program aimed to counterbalance those defections, featuring a video showcasing former Democratic voters who say they now support Trump and remarks from U.S. Representative Jeff Van Drew, who abandoned the Democratic Party to join the Republicans after voting against Trump's impeachment this year.
""Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,"" he said.
FIREWORKS SPECTACLE
Trump, a former reality television host, and his advisers have set up his speech with a producer's eye. His use of the White House as his backdrop has irked critics who say holding a political event there is a potential violation of the law.
Fireworks were expected over Washington's nearby monuments at the conclusion of Trump's speech.
The Republican convention has attracted fewer television viewers than its Democratic counterpart on two of its three nights so far, including on Wednesday, according to early Nielsen Media Research.
A total of 17.3 million people watched the third night of the mostly virtual Republican National Convention on Wednesday, according to Nielsen, fewer than the 22.8 million viewers for the third night of last week's Democratic convention.
Democrats have criticized Trump's aggressive response to demonstrations sparked by the May 25 Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, a Black man.
On Wednesday, Trump said he was sending federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after violent protests there following the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back.
Trump kicked off the week on Monday by accusing Democrats of seeking to steal the election by advocating for mail-in voting. His previous high-profile speeches have also emphasized grim themes, including his inaugural address in January 2017 that described ""American carnage.""",https://ca.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN25O1B9-OCASP,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-election-2020-donald-trump-to-attack-joe-biden-as-us-confronts-coronavirus-anti-racism-protests-5765431.html
2497931,0,1,"Walmart wants to go viral with TikTok, Wall Street thinks it can - Reuters",TikTok is said to wrestle with two competing offers,"(Reuters) - Wall Street was swift to see the rationale behind Walmart Inc jumping into the fray to buy TikTok - access to millions of young, digitally savvy users who could help the 60-year-old company boost its online sales. 
The retailer revealed plans to join Microsoft Corp in a bid for the social media firm’s U.S. assets on Thursday, hours after the video company’s chief executive said he would step down. 
Analysts said Walmart picking up a stake in the short-form video app, which is owned by China’s ByteDance and claims to have about 100 million active monthly users in the United States, could be a game changer for the world’s largest retailer. 
“Connecting with a younger audience is vital to Walmart’s long-term outlook, especially as more digitally native generations move into their prime consumption years,” UBS analyst Michael Lasser said. 
“The lines are blurring between traditional shopping, digital shopping and social media. Walmart needs more exposure to this trend.” 
Companies have been scrambling to advertise and sell on apps like TikTok and Facebook’s Instagram, where shopping has surged, as people spend hours everyday scrolling through the latest viral videos from their favorite influencers. 
About 23% of U.S. users reported making a purchase on Instagram earlier this year, compared to just 15% in late-2019, according to a survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets. 
A combination of Walmart’s e-commerce operations and customer purchase data with Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform and TikTok’s mostly millennial and Gen Z monthly users could create a digital behemoth even more dominant than Amazon.com Inc or Facebook, Jefferies analyst Christopher Mandeville said. 
However, any potential deal will come under intense regulatory scrutiny, with TikTok under fire from the White House as a potential national security risk. 
Oracle Corp has also bid for TikTok’s U.S. operations. 
Twitter livened up with memes after Walmart announced it had teamed up with Microsoft to buy a social media app less than three-years old. 
“Walmart and Microsoft buying Tiktok easily the most ‘hello fellow kids’ move of all time,” Twitter user @ericzawo said. 
Reporting by Uday Sampath and Aniruddha Ghosh in Bengaluru; Editing by Sweta Singh and Sriraj Kalluvila","By Mike IsaacSAN FRANCISCO: The race to buy TikToks U.S. operations has entered its final stages, with two groups submitting bids for the video app, said three people involved in the deal talks. One of the bids was from Microsoft and Walmart, which have teamed up, and the other was from Oracle and could include a coalition of investors, they said.
The discussions remain fluid, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. It is unclear which group will secure a deal, and the makeup of the bidders could still change.
But TikToks owner, Chinese internet company ByteDance, will most likely make a decision on the competing bids in the coming days, they said. And whichever bid is selected is likely to set TikToks U.S. business down very different paths.
A deal with Microsoft and Walmart could draw on Walmarts digital sales background to turn TikTok into a kind of e-commerce app for both creators and users, people involved in the talks said. That could make TikTok more like Douyin, ByteDances TikTok-like Chinese-language video app, which already has e-commerce integrated into it.
A deal with Oracle, the enterprise software company, would be more of a data play. Oracle could use TikToks data about social interactions to benefit its cloud, data and advertising businesses, the people said.
Representatives for TikTok, Microsoft and Oracle declined to comment. In a statement, Walmart confirmed it was participating in the discussions and said, We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of U.S. TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of U.S. government regulators.
Any deal would cap months of turbulence for TikTok, which has been under intense pressure from the Trump administration. White House officials, who have become increasingly tough on China, have said that TikTok poses a national security threat because it could provide data about U.S. users to Beijing. This month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order mandating that TikTok sell its U.S. operations by mid-September or cease transactions within the country.
That pushed ByteDance and TikTok to seek a buyer, in what could amount to a blockbuster deal. Microsoft had already been talking with TikTok and ByteDance about a potential acquisition, people with knowledge of the talks have said. They initially discussed Microsoft taking just a minority stake in TikTok, before the scope of a deal ballooned.
Since then, Oracle and other bidders have also joined the talks. Bankers and others have also called Netflix, Twitter and others to gauge their interest in doing a deal with TikTok, though the degree of interest has varied widely.
Under stipulations set by the White House to alleviate national security concerns, ByteDance would need to sell TikToks U.S. operations to reduce the apps Chinese ownership. It would also have to sell to one or more companies that have a technology services provider, in part to transfer TikToks American user data over to U.S. servers. Both Microsoft and Oracle satisfy those requirements.
Prices for a potential deal have ranged from $20 billion to $50 billion, people with knowledge of the talks have said. It was unclear what bid amounts were submitted.
Microsoft, with $137 billion in cash and a market value of more than $1.7 trillion, is far larger than other potential acquirers and has the deepest resources. Oracle, with a market value of $175 billion, has roughly $43 billion in cash and short-term investments, and also holds debt.
Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors that the participation of Walmart was likely the final piece of the puzzle that ultimately cements Microsoft successfully acquiring TikToks U.S. operations for likely $35 billion to $40 billion.
The emergence of the two bids follows the resignation late Wednesday of TikToks chief executive, Kevin Mayer. Mayer, a former Disney executive who had announced he was joining TikTok in May, said he was resigning because he had signed on for a global role, not to run a carved-up version of the company. In a note to employees, he also indicated that a deal for TikTok might be close.
We expect to reach a resolution very soon, Mayer wrote.
Zhang Yiming, ByteDances chief executive, said in his own note that ByteDance and TikTok were moving swiftly to resolve its issues in the United States and India, where the app was banned in June.
I cannot get into details at this point, but I can assure you that we are developing solutions that will be in the interest of users, creators, partners and employees, Zhang said.
While Microsofts and Oracles interest in a bid for TikToks U.S. operations has been known, Walmarts participation only emerged Thursday. The worlds largest retailer, known for its brick-and-mortar stores, has recently been pushing into digital businesses like entertainment, partly as a way to outpace its rival Amazon.
The lines are blurring between traditional shopping, digital shopping and social media, said Michael Lasser, a retail analyst for UBS. Connecting with a younger audience is vital to Walmarts long-term outlook, especially as more digitally native generations move into their prime consumption years.
The pandemic has shown the importance of e-commerce to Walmart and other big-box retailers. In an earnings report this month, Walmart said its online sales doubled during the quarter.
Microsoft and Walmart have teamed up before. In 2018, the companies announced a multiyear cloud partnership aimed at accelerating Walmarts digital commerce business.
Oracle, on the other hand, has long been rivals with Microsoft. Both compete to provide software and cloud services to businesses. They have battled over similar contracts, such as the $10 billion technology contract for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, known as JEDI, with the Department of Defense. Microsoft won the contract last year.
In Washington, members of the Trump administration have expressed support for a deal with Oracle. Safra Catz, Oracles chief executive, and Lawrence Ellison, Oracles founder and executive chairman, have close relationships with Trump and other members of the White House, having cultivated those ties for years.
This month, Trump told reporters he would support a TikTok sale to Oracle, which he called a great company.
I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it, Trump said.
Whichever bidder wins the TikTok deal will face the challenges of running a user-generated content business. TikTok has made missteps around content moderation, including an incident in which it suppressed videos from queer, disabled and overweight users. And because TikTok appears to be used by a large number of underage users, any acquirer would have to deal with preventing child exploitative behavior on the platform.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-walmart-tiktok-idUSKBN25O28F,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/tiktok-is-said-to-wrestle-with-two-competing-offers/articleshow/77796914.cms
4172514,0,1,"What the conventions reveal for Biden, Trump in final stretch to November","US Election 2020: Donald Trump to attack Joe Biden as US confronts coronavirus, anti-racism protests","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The back-to-back presidential nominating conventions that concluded with Donald Trump’s speech on Thursday showed both sides intend to fight for the sliver of independent and moderate voters that will decide the election, each with a wildly different strategy in the final sprint to Nov. 3. 
A self-styled showman, Trump used all of his reality-show talents during the Republican convention this week to try to win back supporters alienated by his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with a dire warning of a lawless America if his Democratic rival Joe Biden takes power. 
That illustrated the Republican strategy for the next two months: change the subject from a pandemic that has killed 180,000 Americans and shackled the U.S. economy, and blame Democrats for the violence on the streets. 
Republicans largely abandoned talk of the health crisis as if it had abated, in favor of reminding voters of the robust economy that existed beforehand. During the Democratic convention the previous week, Biden put the focus on holding Trump accountable for his actions during the outbreak. 
“These two conventions have offered very different pictures of reality, in terms of where our country is now and what our future may hold,” said Christopher Devine, an expert in U.S. elections at the University of Dayton in Ohio. 
Trump’s convention depicted the president as a champion of “law and order,” taking aim at voters who do not approve of his divisive and inflammatory rhetoric but may be jittery about months of protests over racial injustice and police brutality that have sometimes turned violent. 
“This is their attempt to nail down the base and mobilize them to get out and vote,” said Kathleen Dolan, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 
“But I do think he is trying to peel away some of those undecided women, the people who he’s calling the ‘suburban women.’” 
Biden holds a seven point lead over Trump nationally, about the same position he held before the conventions, according to the Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll conducted Aug. 19-25. But it showed the race for suburban voters narrowing, a worrying sign for the former vice president who had previously expanded his lead with the crucial voting group. 
Suburban women - a cohort considered key to the election - have become less critical of Trump than they were in June, and Biden’s advantage with this group has narrowed to nine points in the latest poll, compared to a 15-point advantage over Trump in a similar Reuters/Ipsos poll in June. 
The August poll also showed Biden with a 5-point lead with college-educated white Americans, compared with his 7-point lead in July and an 11-point advantage in June. 
But in reaching out to suburban voters with unapologetic tough-on-crime messages, while showing little empathy for the protesters who demand racial justice, Trump may have further bolstered Black American support for Biden, already strong. 
Trump’s message would have been more powerful before the pandemic, said Kyle Kondik, an analyst for the University of Virginia Center for Politics. 
“It could be successful if COVID is not as much of a focus in the fall as it is now. That seems hard to imagine, but it’s possible,” he said. 
PITCH TO THE MIDDLE 
While lauding Trump at every turn, his convention was just as much about convincing wavering Republicans or undecided voters that Biden - who ran largely as a centrist candidate in the Democratic primary - would be beholden to the far-left elements of his party. 
A bevy of speakers accused Biden of turning a blind eye to the crime and violence that have marred mostly peaceful protests over racial justice, sparked by the police killing in May of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis. The latest police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, led to a fresh wave of protests. 
Ford O’Connell, a Republican consultant close to the Trump campaign, said much of the convention’s programming was directed at voters who “might have soured” on Trump because of his divisive style or were still looking for reasons to support him. 
First lady Melania Trump expressed sympathy for those who had suffered because of the pandemic, a gesture of solace that her husband has rarely shown, and Vice President Mike Pence offered a more statesmanlike critique of Biden that may have appealed to Republicans weary of the president’s invective. 
Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist in Virginia not affiliated with the Trump campaign, said the unrest this week in Kenosha, a small city in Wisconsin, may bolster Trump in ways other protests have not. 
With the pandemic still raging and the economy struggling, “chaos and uncertainty are the best friend he has,” Donovan said. 
VIOLENCE AS STRATEGY? 
Speaking at a fundraiser on Thursday, Biden too suggested Trump welcomed chaos. “The violence you’re seeing is in Donald Trump’s administration, Donald Trump’s America. Did they forget who’s president?” Biden said. “Violence isn’t a problem in Trump’s eyes. It’s a political strategy.” 
The protests have been a thorny issue for Biden, who would rather keep the focus on the virus. While showing solidarity with demonstrators, he has also criticized the destruction of communities and has not backed the de-funding of police departments as called for by activists in his party. 
But Jim Messina, who was President Barack Obama’s campaign manager for the 2012 reelection, said Republicans’ fiery rhetoric against protests, which have been mostly peaceful despite sometimes violent clashes, could turn off independents who want an end to the bitter polarization.

“Trump has gone so far right that he’s left the middle for the taking,” he said. 
Biden’s convention underscored profound fears within the party that voter turnout may be depressed by the pandemic as well as Trump’s efforts to limit mail-in voting, which Trump has denounced as prone to fraud despite no such evidence. 
Former first lady Michelle Obama urged Americans to “vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.”

Additional reporting by Joseph Ax, Trevor Hunnicutt and Chris Kahn, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Howard Goller","President Donald Trump prepared to attack Democratic rival Joe Biden in front of a large crowd on the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday, as the United States struggles to address the coronavirus pandemic and a wave of anti-racism protests.
Trailing in national opinion polls less than 10 weeks before the Nov. 3 election, Trump will accept his party's nomination on the Republican National Convention's final night with a speech asserting that a Biden victory would only worsen the crises besieging the country.
""At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" Trump was expected to say, according to excerpts provided to Reuters ahead of the evening.
""We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years,"" he would say, referring to Biden's career as a U.S. senator and vice president.
Though an incumbent seeking a second four-year term, Trump remains a self-styled outsider, an approach that won him the White House, his first elected office, in 2016 on a promise to end the crime and violence he said was afflicting the country.
His convention's first three nights focused heavily on trying to convince Americans that Democrats, not the Trump administration, are to blame for the racial strife convulsing U.S. cities. Several speakers accused Biden of wanting to defund the police, even though he has rejected that position.
At a fundraiser on Thursday, Biden, 77, said Trump, 74 had used the specter of violence as a ""political strategy,"" rather than actually aiming to address it. Democrats formally nominated Biden at a convention last week.
""Donald Trump keeps saying it won't be safe in Joe Biden's America,"" he said. ""Their proof? The violence you're seeing is in Donald Trump's administration, Donald Trump's America. Did they forget who's president?""
Trump's decision to speak from the White House lawn to an expected crowd of more than 1,000 has drawn criticism that he is using the official residence for partisan purposes and ignoring the risk of coronavirus transmission.
Hours before Trump's speech, a large crowd assembled in white chairs, with little evidence of social distancing or face masks, despite health experts' recommendations. The coronavirus prompted both political parties to scale back their conventions and make events mostly virtual.
The Trump campaign said it had taken appropriate health precautions.
About 300 anti-Trump protesters gathered on Black Lives Matter Plaza nearby, playing music and dancing ahead of Trump's speech.
NATION UNDER SIEGE
More than 180,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus - more than any other country, according to a Reuters tally - amid a fresh wave of protests over the latest high-profile police shooting of a Black American.
In Kenosha, Wisconsin, relative calm returned after three nights of civil strife ending on Tuesday - including arson, vandalism and deadly shootings - sparked by a police shooting that paralyzed a Black man.
Trump, a former New York real estate developer, is seeking to turn around a re-election campaign that has been largely overshadowed by a health crisis that has put millions of Americans out of work.
While his approval rating among Republican voters remains high, dissent is mounting within the party. In three open letters being published on Thursday and Friday, Biden won endorsements from more than 160 people who worked for Republican former President George W. Bush or for past Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, the New York Times and Politico reported.
Earlier this week, 27 former Republican lawmakers endorsed Biden while the Lincoln Project, among the most prominent Republican-backed groups opposing Trump, said a former Republican Party head had joined it as a senior adviser.
Thursday's program aimed to counterbalance those defections, featuring a video showcasing former Democratic voters who say they now support Trump and remarks from U.S. Representative Jeff Van Drew, who abandoned the Democratic Party to join the Republicans after voting against Trump's impeachment this year.
""Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,"" he said.
FIREWORKS SPECTACLE
Trump, a former reality television host, and his advisers have set up his speech with a producer's eye. His use of the White House as his backdrop has irked critics who say holding a political event there is a potential violation of the law.
Fireworks were expected over Washington's nearby monuments at the conclusion of Trump's speech.
The Republican convention has attracted fewer television viewers than its Democratic counterpart on two of its three nights so far, including on Wednesday, according to early Nielsen Media Research.
A total of 17.3 million people watched the third night of the mostly virtual Republican National Convention on Wednesday, according to Nielsen, fewer than the 22.8 million viewers for the third night of last week's Democratic convention.
Democrats have criticized Trump's aggressive response to demonstrations sparked by the May 25 Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, a Black man.
On Wednesday, Trump said he was sending federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after violent protests there following the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back.
Trump kicked off the week on Monday by accusing Democrats of seeking to steal the election by advocating for mail-in voting. His previous high-profile speeches have also emphasized grim themes, including his inaugural address in January 2017 that described ""American carnage.""",https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN25O1B5,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-election-2020-donald-trump-to-attack-joe-biden-as-us-confronts-coronavirus-anti-racism-protests-5765431.html
5989668,0,1,What to watch on August 28: Masaba Masaba is streaming on Netflix,Aashram review: Bobby Deol’s show has a bark that’s worse than its bite - Hindustan Times,"Masaba Masaba is available on Netflix.Cinema halls might be far away from reopening doors, but theres no dearth of content for viewers to binge-watch. To say that the web became a saviour to quench our thirst for entertainment during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, wont be wrong. Streaming giants like ZEE5, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus Hotstar, Voot Select, SonyLIV and several others are regularly churning out new stuff for its viewers. Adding to it are dozens of movies premiering on OTT platforms.
This weeks big OTT releases include Sadak 2, which marks the return of Mahesh Bhatt as a director after 21 years. This is also the first time he is collaborating with daughter Alia Bhatt, who will share screen space with Aditya Roy Kapur. Sadak actor Sanjay Dutt is also making a comeback in the sequel. Sadak 2 is a sequel to Bhatts 1991 directorial Sadak, which also starred Pooja Bhatt and Sadashiv Amrapurkar. Going by the trailer of Sadak 2, it looks like the movie is a revenge drama against a godman, played by Makarand Deshpande. While Dutt is seen reprising his role as a taxi driver from the original film, Alia and Aditya are lovers who rent his services, until the trio strike a bond against the common enemy. Produced by Vishesh Films, Sadak 2 will premiere on Disney Plus Hotstar VIP.
Also releasing this weekend is actor Bobby Deol and director Prakash Jhas web series Aashram on MX Player. Bobby, who was recently seen playing a police officer in Netflix film Class of 83, will be seen as a godman in the series, which also features Chandan Roy Sanyal, Aaditi Pohankar, Darshan Kumaar, and Adhyayan Suman in pivotal roles.
Netflix series Masaba Masaba will see mother-daughter duo Masaba Gupta and Neena Gupta onscreen for the first time. The show, which releases on Friday, is based on their real-life moments and offers a peek into their journey, with references and anecdotes set against a fictional backdrop.
Talking about Aashram, Bobby Deol told indianexpress.com, The most attractive thing about Aashram was that it gave me a chance to work with Prakash ji (director Prakash Jha). All these years, I had been watching his movies, waiting to work with him one day. I was so excited the day he called me to his office, and when he narrated the idea to me, I was like wow. I was amazed because as an actor, I am always trying to look for different kinds of characters to play, and it is not easy to catch hold of good parts. The last project that I did for an OTT platform, I was not the first choice. But for this project, I was happy to hear that I was Prakash jis first choice.","AashramDirector - Prakash JhaCast - Bobby Deol, Aaditi Pohankar, Chandan Roy Sanyal, Darshan Kumaar, Anupriya Goenka
Aashram, on MX Player, is as inconsistent as Bobby Deol’s accent. While the actor struggles to shrug off his urbane aura, the series — about one of those dhongi babas that you read about in the news — never fully lives up to the potential of its premise. It isn’t as lurid as it should have been, but that doesn’t stop it from being absolutely ludicrous.
Aashram begins with a disclaimer nearly as long as this review. It’s unlike any I’ve ever seen — not simply plain text against a plainer background, but positively festooned with excesses, like Baba Nirala himself. Played by a buff Bobby Deol, the benevolent Baba is a beguiling figure, revered and feared in equal measure. 
Watch the Aashram trailer here 
After a young Dalit girl’s family is violently attacked by upper caste men for having dared to enter their neighbourhood, she goes to the police to register an FIR. But the cops, who are either corrupt or in cahoots with the powerful families, dissuade her from filing her complaint. She is told that more bodies will fall in retaliation. So for justice, like Amerigo Bonasera from The Godfather, she turns to the Baba. Oh, and the opening scene of Aashram, like that of Francis Ford Coppola’s masterpiece, is also set during a wedding.
These aren’t the only narrative and thematic parallels that series director Prakash Jha draws between Aashram and The Godfather. Later episodes also introduce a Johnny Fontane-esque pop-star, played by Adhyayan Suman. But to make comparisons between the two would be to insult Coppola, and to give Jha undue credit. 
Fans of his high-impact brand of socio-political cinema might respond to Aashram, but for those who do not consider films such as Gangaajal and Rajneeti to be modern classics will be dissatisfied by the show’s lack of subtlety.
For instance, Aashram all but abandons some of the most compelling ideas posed in its opening episode. Perennial Prakash Jha themes such as caste and corruption are sidelined in favour of random romantic subplots and a police procedural arc that was done so much better in Sacred Games and Paatal Lok. For the second time in two weeks, after the underwhelming Class of 83, star Bobby Deol finds himself reduced to a supporting presence when he should have, logically, been given a role befitting his top-billing. There’s a frigid quality to his performance where there should have been a fluidity. 
On occasion, it seems as if Jha diverted the majority of the budget to Deol’s scenes, to the point that any time that the actor isn’t on screen — which is often — there is a noticeable drop in production value. Some scenes even appear to have been filmed with DSLRs. This isn’t to say that the cameras are to blame — we’ve seen splendid films shot on iPhones — but this makes the story seem sloppily un-cinematic. 
Not one, but two characters have such a drastic change of heart after that opening episode, that neither I nor the show could properly recover. Had this evolution unfolded gradually, over the course of nine episodes, I’d have had a much easier time believing it. But for a blatantly corrupt policeman in Uttar Pradesh to become a beacon of honesty in the span of a few minutes, mainly because he wants to woo a colleague, would be a tough twist to swallow for just about anyone. 
Aashram is a sanitised telling of a potentially scandalous story. Never is this more apparent than in the handful of ‘sex scenes’ that the show forcefully inserts into the narrative. While the characters mysteriously forget how to kiss in one of them — they regularly miss their target, instead finding the sides of each other’s mouths, or even a nose — each of these scenes, for some bizarre reason, has been self-censored. 
For viewers, this could be irritatingly underwhelming, especially since the language and the violence aren’t censored at all. Now compare this to the ‘guruji ka pyaar bhi mila’ scene from Sacred Games, or the orgy from Wild Wild Country, or the countless stories we’ve read about the goings-on in Ram Rahim Singh’s Sirsa compound.
Also read: Wild Wild Country review: Netflix’s unbelievable inside look at Osho’s ‘sex cult’ will haunt you for days
That’s the general sense that Aashram leaves you with. It’s a show that doesn’t have the courage of its convictions. The self-censorship of sex scenes is emblematic of the trepidation with which Jha approaches the story. As it turns out, that ridiculous disclaimer was utterly unnecessary.

4674848,0,1,"Republican convention praise of Trump economy is risky strategy, poll highlights - Reuters","No masks. social distancing: At GOP's convention, Covid is largely ignored","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans’ support for President Donald Trump’s management of the economy has slipped, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows, challenging a bedrock re-election argument laid out at the Republican National Convention this week. 
About 58% of respondents said the U.S. economy is on the wrong track in a survey taken August 19 through 25th. 
And for the first time this year, Trump’s net approval on economic issues dipped into negative territory, with 47% saying they approved of his stewardship of the American economy and 48% saying they disapproved. That is down from an approval margin of 14 percentage points in late March. 
While the poll shows Trump still has an edge with voters over Democratic opponent Joe Biden on the economy, the results highlight the risks the Republican Party is taking by leaning on memories of last year’s strong economy and arguing that Trump will easily be able to restore it. 
“Our economic choice is very clear. Do you want economic health, prosperity, opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation, recession and pessimism?” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said at the convention on Tuesday night. 
“Who do you trust to rebuild this economy?,” Vice President Mike Pence asked Wednesday night. “A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world?” 
BOUNCE AHEAD, BUT THEN WHAT? 
Looking to the fall, just as the U.S. witnessed a historic drop here in gross domestic product from April through June, Trump will be able to trumpet a record increase - equivalent to perhaps 25% on an annualized basis - when statistics are released in October covering the July to September period. 
Neither data point, products of a deliberate shutdown of the economy in March and the automatic impact of reopening from that sudden stop, say much about the economic fortunes of families and businesses during the first months of the pandemic, or in the weeks to come. 
The coronavirus health crisis, with nearly 6 million infected and over 175,000 Americans dead, is still raging. The onset of the conventional flu season is on the horizon, and an experiment underway in reopening schools and colleges is already leading to new spikes in infections. 
Consumer confidence, which can influence future economic activity, remains weak. The national unemployment rate at 10.2% in July is the highest in 39 years, and improvement seems to be slowing. Nearly 15 million Americans are receiving unemployment benefits, the highest on record and double the number hit during the 2007 to 2009 Great Recession. 
The blow has been received hardest among groups including blacks, Hispanics and women who benefited most from last year’s record low unemployment rate. Continued support among white women in particular will be critical to Trump’s electoral chances. 
TRUMP EDGE OVER BIDEN 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll found most voters would not currently back Biden on the economy. 
Trump’s team has been hammering Biden’s discussion of tax policies to pay for rising government debt due to the Trump administration’s earlier tax cuts. 
Among registered voters, Trump still has a five-point edge over Biden in who would be better to manage the economy. 
But the poll also found 30% of Republicans felt the economy was on the wrong track, the highest since February 2018 when Reuters/Ipsos started tracking the question. 
The poll gathered responses from 4,428 American adults, including 1,929 Democrats, 1,750 Republicans and 430 independents. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of between 2-5 percentage points. 
If the economic impact of the pandemic has been in some ways less severe than feared, with household spending returning to pre-pandemic levels and Americans boosting their savings, it is only because of massive government spending and a larger federal footprint in the economy. 
Both Republican and Democratic leaning economists feel much more federal help and a larger federal footprint will be needed to avoid a deeper slide this fall - steps that Trump would have to embrace even as he tries to brand Biden a “socialist.” 
The lapse of $600 a week unemployment benefits, the expiration of loans for small businesses, and the lack of help for state and local governments may in short order pull the rug from economic data that has been more positive than expected since a wave of business lockdowns and social distancing measures in April. 
A Census survey in July said reported “food insecurity” rose more than 20% early in the pandemic, reaching nearly 30 million. 
As former Fed chair Janet Yellen and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities senior adviser Jared Bernstein said in a New York Times column, a lot more people are hungry. 
Both have been briefing Biden on economic issues, and wrote that without further federal spending, “millions of needy Americans will suffer and the overall economy could degrade from its current slow rebound in growth to no growth at all.” 
Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Heather Timmons and Alistair Bell","It was a stunning scene in a country where parents and children have been laid to rest without their loved ones present, schools have gone to online-only learning and businesses have shut their doors to halt the spread of the coronavirus.
On Thursday night, about 1,500 people gathered on the South Lawn of the White House so President Donald Trump could accept his party's nomination for reelection in front of a roaring crowd.
Masks were not required and chairs were placed inches apart from one another, with no room for social distancing, in violation of endless public health recommendations.
Only those the White House expected to be in ""close proximity"" to the president and vice president had been tested for COVID-19.
As Trump has tried to push past a pandemic that has tanked the economy and threatened his reelection chances, GOP organisers have worked to stage a convention that puts the virus in the rear view mirror and highlights the nation's progress, even as it continues to spread.
More than 42,000 new cases were reported Wednesday and 2,700 more have died since the week began.
But few convention speakers made reference to the virus, while others have discussed it in the past tense.
It was awful. Health and economic impacts were tragic, said White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on the convention's second night. But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.
The display stands in jarring contrast with the Democrats, who dispensed with audiences at live speeches during their virtual convention last week.
Presidential nominee Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris also wore masks, even when they were outside and standing apart from one another.
Is coronavirus gone? Is COVID-19 gone? Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders asked Thursday on a call with reporters. I didn't see any masks or social distancing happening during the vice president's speech last night. So, the reality is, there is a lack of leadership here.
To be sure, the Republicans' event looked very different from past conventions. Because of the virus, the GOP cancelled what would have been mass gatherings drawing thousands to North Carolina or Florida, and they have been consulting with a coronavirus adviser. Indoor speeches were delivered without audiences. But outdoor events have featured guests.
That included a Rose Garden address Tuesday by first lady Melania Trump, who spoke about the toll of the virus, and Vice President Mike Pence's speech Wednesday, delivered in front of about 100 people, including Pence's family and wounded veterans, at Fort McHenry in Baltimore.
After Pence had spoken, a scene unfolded that seemed from a bygone era, as audience members moved from their chairs and gathered near the stage to greet him, Trump and their wives.
While the president and first lady appeared to keep their distance, Pence was seen shaking hands, exchanging fist bumps, and at one point accepting a small gift from an audience member. No one appeared concerned about social distancing. Few in the crowd were seen wearing masks. And some told reporters they had not been tested for the virus before attending the speech.
The White House and campaign refused to say how many in attendance at the events had been tested for the virus. White House spokesman Judd Deere said only that those in close proximity to the president and vice president are screened.
And while Washington, DC, mandates that masks be worn in public places, guidance sent to those invited to Thursday's event specified that masks would not be required on the South Lawn, though they would be needed upon arrival and in security screening areas and encouraged in high traffic areas including restrooms and hospitality spaces.
Guests were also asked to practice social distancing whenever possible and stay home if they were displaying coronavirus symptoms, had recently tested positive for the virus or had been in recent close contact with someone who had.
Robert G Darling, who served a physician to former President Bill Clinton and is the chief medical officer of the Patronus Medical Corp, said the group has been working with the RNC on the convention to make certain proper protocols are in place to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals at convention venues"".
He said those protocols are in line with city and federal guidelines and that health professionals have been on-site to make certain screening has been done on a consistent basis to ensure the convention meets the highest standards of public safety"".
But the refusal to abide by other widely accepted mitigation recommendations including those promoted by the president's own heath agencies confounded public health experts watching at home.
The president and the entire RNC, they had an opportunity to show the seriousness of this pandemic, which is the worst public health crisis in our lifetimes, and it's extremely concerning that only did they not discuss precautions like wearing masks and social distancing, they are going against all of our public health guidance,"" said Dr Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy at The George Washington University and the former health commissioner of Baltimore.

The petitioners have contended that the said decision fails to ensure the safety, security and right to life of the student candidates appearing for the said exams.
The review petitions further state that the NTA has ignored the logistical difficulties in carrying the examinations on the proposed dates and also failed to balance the competing but equally crucial aspect of conducting the examination and safety of the students. The review petitioners have also raised the issue of lack of mandatory safeguards for carrying the examinations.
The review petitioners have stated that nearly 25 lakh students will appear for the examinations in the midst of the pandemic and at a time when the country has recorded over 3.31 million COVID-19 cases.
With JEE being proposed to be conducted in over 660 exam centres for 9.53 lakh students, roughly 1,443 students will be writing the exam per JEE centre and for the NEET UG exams, 15.97 lakh students are slated to appear in 3,843 centres, meaning that there will be 415 students per NEET exam centre, the pleas state.
The review petitions have been filed by the Cabinet Ministers of six states in their individual capacities.
These are Moloy Ghatak, Minister-in-Charge, Department of Labour &amp; E.S.I. (MB) Scheme and Departments of Law &amp; Judicial, West Bengal; Dr Rameshwar Oraon, Finance Minister, Jharkhand; Dr Raghu Sharma, Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Rajasthan; Amarjeet Bhagat, Indian Minister of Food, Civil supplies, Culture, Planning, Chhattisgarh; Balbir Singh Sidhu, Minister of Health and Family Welfare &amp; Labour, Punjab and Uday Ravindra Samant, Minister of Higher and Technical Education, Maharashtra.
Challenging the SC decision, the review petitioners have said that the Apex Court failed to appreciate that the Union Government had adequate time to establish at least one centre for every district for NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) rather than having several centres in one district. Having at least one centre per district would have minimised the inter-district long travel of the students and thereby reduced the chances of COVID-19 spread.","Coronavirus India Updates: The Covid-19 recoveries in India have exceeded the active cases by over 18 lakh as of Friday while there has been a huge reduction in the fatality rate, the Centre, highlighting its ‘test, track and treat’ approach, said today. With more patients recovering and being discharged from home isolation and hospitals, the country’s recoveries is nearing 26 lakh, it added.
“Effective treatment of positive cases has resulted in a progressively dipping Covid case fatality rate, which is pegged at 1.82 per cent as on date,” the Union health ministry said.
With 77,266 cases in 24 hours, the Covid-19 tally in India rose to 3,387,500 earlier in the day with the death toll at 61,529.
Here is a look at the top developments: 
In its latest set of coronavirus guidelines for flyers, the Centre has allowed airlines to serve pre-packed snacks, meals and beverages on domestic flights depending on the travel time, and hot meals on international flights.
Besides this, the government has also directed passengers who refuse to wear a face mask in a flight to be put on the no-fly list, a senior official of the aviation regulator DGCA said. The airline and its cabin crew are sufficiently empowered under the existing DGCA rules to take action in this regard, the official added.
Airlines may serve pre-packed snacks/meals/pre-packed beverages on domestic flights depending on the duration of flight, an order issued by the Civil Aviation Ministry said on Thursday.
The Supreme Court Friday refused to entertain a petition seeking postponement of the Bihar Assembly elections due to the coronavirus pandemic. A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan and comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah left it to the Election Commission decide the schedule.
The apex court was hearing a petition filed by one Avinash Thakur, who sought direction to the Chief Election Commissioner to postpone the election till the state was free of Covid-19.
The SC also said the petition was premature, as the EC was yet to announce the schedule for the elections. The poll body, however, has announced a slew of guidelines for holding elections during the pandemic.
Defence ministry to host Aero-India in Bengaluru in February
Notwithstanding the pandemic, the defence ministry has taken an in-principle decision to host the next edition of Aero India, considered Asia’s largest aerospace exhibition, in Bengaluru from February 3-5 next year, officials said.
Sources told news agency PTI that Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had already held a number of internal meetings on hosting the mega event.
“It was decided that the event will be hosted while taking maximum precaution against the coronavirus pandemic,” the source was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.
6 ministers of opposition-ruled states move SC seeking review of order on NEET, JEE
Amid the row over the NEET and JEE entrance exams scheduled for next month, six ministers on Friday moved the Supreme Court, seeking review of its order permitting the Centre to conduct the exams this year.
The review plea was filed by ministers from West Bengal (Moloy Ghatak), Jharkhand (Rameshwar Oraon), Rajasthan (Raghu Sharma), Chhattisgarh (Amarjeet Bhagat), Punjab (B S Sidhu) and Maharashtra (Uday Ravindra Sawant). The plea has been filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes.
BJP’s attitude towards students ‘devoid of humanity’: Akhilesh Yadav
Targeting the BJP over the holding of the JEE and NEET exams amid the pandemic, Samajwadi Party Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said the party’s attitude towards students is “devoid of humanity”.
“Adamant on conducting JEE and NEET examinations, BJP has now clarified why it has changed the name of the Ministry of Human Resources. It is because its attitude towards education and students is devoid of humanity,” the former chief minister tweeted while tagging pictures of the protest by his partymen in the state capital on Thursday.
The Supreme Court today said that states and universities cannot promote students without holding final year exams. The court, however, added that they can approach the University Grants Commission (UGC) to seek an extension of deadline for holding the exams. Earlier, the UGC guidelines had asked universities to hold the exams by September 30.
States can postpone final year exams under Disaster Management Act but fresh dates have to be fixed in consultation with UGC, it said.

7433511,0,1,TikTok is said to wrestle with two competing offers,TikTok booms in Southeast Asia as it picks path through political minefields,"By Mike IsaacSAN FRANCISCO: The race to buy TikToks U.S. operations has entered its final stages, with two groups submitting bids for the video app, said three people involved in the deal talks. One of the bids was from Microsoft and Walmart, which have teamed up, and the other was from Oracle and could include a coalition of investors, they said.
The discussions remain fluid, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. It is unclear which group will secure a deal, and the makeup of the bidders could still change.
But TikToks owner, Chinese internet company ByteDance, will most likely make a decision on the competing bids in the coming days, they said. And whichever bid is selected is likely to set TikToks U.S. business down very different paths.
A deal with Microsoft and Walmart could draw on Walmarts digital sales background to turn TikTok into a kind of e-commerce app for both creators and users, people involved in the talks said. That could make TikTok more like Douyin, ByteDances TikTok-like Chinese-language video app, which already has e-commerce integrated into it.
A deal with Oracle, the enterprise software company, would be more of a data play. Oracle could use TikToks data about social interactions to benefit its cloud, data and advertising businesses, the people said.
Representatives for TikTok, Microsoft and Oracle declined to comment. In a statement, Walmart confirmed it was participating in the discussions and said, We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of U.S. TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of U.S. government regulators.
Any deal would cap months of turbulence for TikTok, which has been under intense pressure from the Trump administration. White House officials, who have become increasingly tough on China, have said that TikTok poses a national security threat because it could provide data about U.S. users to Beijing. This month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order mandating that TikTok sell its U.S. operations by mid-September or cease transactions within the country.
That pushed ByteDance and TikTok to seek a buyer, in what could amount to a blockbuster deal. Microsoft had already been talking with TikTok and ByteDance about a potential acquisition, people with knowledge of the talks have said. They initially discussed Microsoft taking just a minority stake in TikTok, before the scope of a deal ballooned.
Since then, Oracle and other bidders have also joined the talks. Bankers and others have also called Netflix, Twitter and others to gauge their interest in doing a deal with TikTok, though the degree of interest has varied widely.
Under stipulations set by the White House to alleviate national security concerns, ByteDance would need to sell TikToks U.S. operations to reduce the apps Chinese ownership. It would also have to sell to one or more companies that have a technology services provider, in part to transfer TikToks American user data over to U.S. servers. Both Microsoft and Oracle satisfy those requirements.
Prices for a potential deal have ranged from $20 billion to $50 billion, people with knowledge of the talks have said. It was unclear what bid amounts were submitted.
Microsoft, with $137 billion in cash and a market value of more than $1.7 trillion, is far larger than other potential acquirers and has the deepest resources. Oracle, with a market value of $175 billion, has roughly $43 billion in cash and short-term investments, and also holds debt.
Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors that the participation of Walmart was likely the final piece of the puzzle that ultimately cements Microsoft successfully acquiring TikToks U.S. operations for likely $35 billion to $40 billion.
The emergence of the two bids follows the resignation late Wednesday of TikToks chief executive, Kevin Mayer. Mayer, a former Disney executive who had announced he was joining TikTok in May, said he was resigning because he had signed on for a global role, not to run a carved-up version of the company. In a note to employees, he also indicated that a deal for TikTok might be close.
We expect to reach a resolution very soon, Mayer wrote.
Zhang Yiming, ByteDances chief executive, said in his own note that ByteDance and TikTok were moving swiftly to resolve its issues in the United States and India, where the app was banned in June.
I cannot get into details at this point, but I can assure you that we are developing solutions that will be in the interest of users, creators, partners and employees, Zhang said.
While Microsofts and Oracles interest in a bid for TikToks U.S. operations has been known, Walmarts participation only emerged Thursday. The worlds largest retailer, known for its brick-and-mortar stores, has recently been pushing into digital businesses like entertainment, partly as a way to outpace its rival Amazon.
The lines are blurring between traditional shopping, digital shopping and social media, said Michael Lasser, a retail analyst for UBS. Connecting with a younger audience is vital to Walmarts long-term outlook, especially as more digitally native generations move into their prime consumption years.
The pandemic has shown the importance of e-commerce to Walmart and other big-box retailers. In an earnings report this month, Walmart said its online sales doubled during the quarter.
Microsoft and Walmart have teamed up before. In 2018, the companies announced a multiyear cloud partnership aimed at accelerating Walmarts digital commerce business.
Oracle, on the other hand, has long been rivals with Microsoft. Both compete to provide software and cloud services to businesses. They have battled over similar contracts, such as the $10 billion technology contract for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, known as JEDI, with the Department of Defense. Microsoft won the contract last year.
In Washington, members of the Trump administration have expressed support for a deal with Oracle. Safra Catz, Oracles chief executive, and Lawrence Ellison, Oracles founder and executive chairman, have close relationships with Trump and other members of the White House, having cultivated those ties for years.
This month, Trump told reporters he would support a TikTok sale to Oracle, which he called a great company.
I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it, Trump said.
Whichever bidder wins the TikTok deal will face the challenges of running a user-generated content business. TikTok has made missteps around content moderation, including an incident in which it suppressed videos from queer, disabled and overweight users. And because TikTok appears to be used by a large number of underage users, any acquirer would have to deal with preventing child exploitative behavior on the platform.","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - At 19, Sandy Saputra is big on TikTok Indonesia. Within a year, he’s leapt from quiet, small-town life to star influencer status as more than 10.5 million followers lap up his toothy grin in dancing, pranking and lip-synching videos on the booming app. 
Sandy’s success, becoming his family’s main breadwinner as global brands like Coca Cola or Suntory pay to have their names on his light-hearted clips, comes as TikTok mushrooms across Southeast Asia. Data trackers show it’s been downloaded hundreds of millions of times already in a region with a collective population of 630 million - half of them under 30. 
But it also comes as concerns over how secure user data is in the hands of its Chinese owner ByteDance summon big storm clouds elsewhere - TikTok has been banned in India and President Donald Trump has ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations, triggering the resignation on Thursday of only recently installed CEO Kevin Mayer. 
Southeast Asia offers a clear view of the global strategy ByteDance is implementing to avoid crackdowns in other regions that influencers like Saputra now fear. The approach is to launch ‘non-political’ products fast, promising to governments in places like Vietnam that content will be tightly policed in accordance with local laws, according to interviews with a dozen current and former employees. 
The region is now key to the future of TikTok and ByteDance: The Chinese firm is already plugging TikTok as part of a suite of interconnected apps for live video streaming, messaging and music, tackling U.S. behemoths Facebook and Google head on as both pour billions into Southeast Asia. 
ByteDance declined to comment for this article, and it’s unclear whether or how the prospective sale of operations in the United States and elsewhere might effect Southeast Asia. But in his base in Sukabumi, West Java province, Saputra is only too aware of risks. 
""Of course I do think about it ... It would be so disappointing if TikTok was erased from Indonesia,"" Saputra told Reuters, speaking before filming a sketch www.tiktok.com/@sandys.ss in a paddy field. 
“It wasn’t planned out. I was an ordinary person, making videos like any other normal person, who didn’t have an idea on how this would play out,” said Saputra, now adding hundreds of thousands of TikTok followers every week. 
SISTER APPS 
In the meantime, TikTok is ploughing ahead testing ‘creator’ marketplaces across the region, championing influencers like Saputra, and negotiating data deals with telecoms firms to keep a lid on consumers’ smartphone bills, according to interviews with current and former staffers. 
It’s chasing small to medium-sized businesses as advertisers - nearly nine out of every 10 firms in Southeast Asia are classified as small - complete with how-to-advertise seminars, millions of dollars in advertising credits, and a self-service platform for businesses to make their own ads. 
TikTok is piloting live-streaming commercial initiatives pioneered in China, Southeast Asia business marketing head Chew Wee Ng said in an interview with Reuters. Meanwhile ByteDance is heavily promoting sister apps like Singapore-headquartered business messaging service Lark and music streaming service Resso. 
“TikTok is really unique in that people expect to see advertisers and they want to co-create with brands,” said Ng, a former Google executive based in Singapore. 
According to data from app analytics firm Sensor Tower, TikTok has had more than 360 millions downloads in Southeast Asia, nearly half of them in Indonesia, with 151% growth year-on-year for 2020. 
An internal ByteDance 2019 presentation reviewed by Reuters showed that last year TikTok had 43.5 million monthly active users in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, with the majority female, the biggest online consumers in the region. 
The app grew staggeringly fast in recent months, sources said, as lockdowns enforced across the region to tackle the coronavirus pandemic forced people to stay home. In Indonesia, Saputra said he’s been acquiring 100,000 followers every three days. 
LOCAL MODERATORS 
With growth has come increased government scrutiny, but ByteDance has already had plenty of experience dealing with that. As on other business matters, ByteDance declined to comment on its handling of scrutiny. 
Indonesia presented one of its first major global policy challenges in 2018, after authorities briefly banned TikTok for posts they said contained “pornography, inappropriate content and blasphemy”. 
Within 24 hours, the firm had dispatched senior executives to negotiate with Indonesia, promising to raise the age of its users and to hire a team of local moderators, according to sources and to the-then Indonesian communications minister. 
It would quickly copy this approach by installing moderators across its Southeast Asian markets in a bid to insure compliance with local laws. 
Reuters reported in August that from 2018 until 2020, ByteDance censored content that it perceived as critical of the Chinese government on a news aggregator app in Indonesia known as BaBe at the behest of ByteDance’s China headquarters. 
As of August 2020, most of the content guidelines have been localised for individual Southeast Asian countries. That has often meant strict censorship of local political content. 
In Thailand, where a youth protest movement is challenging the country’s monarchy, some users told Reuters their pro-protest videos had been taken down. [L4N2FK2IX] 
‘IN VIETNAM, CHINA IS POLITICAL’ 
In Vietnam, TikTok has blocked most political content for years, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company declined to comment. 
Hanoi has been in a long-running conflict with U.S. tech giants over demands to restrict any content deemed against the state and create local offices in Vietnam. 
Reuters reported in April that Facebook agreed to increase censorship of “anti-state” posts in Vietnam after its local servers were temporarily taken off-line. [L3N2CA1L0] 
ByteDance, which unlike big U.S. tech players does have an office in the country, decided to pre-empt issues with the government by promising to make its app ‘non-political’. 
Due to Vietnam’s contentious relationship with China, ByteDance decided it would also ban content critical of Beijing, and anything related to tensions between the two governments. 
“In Vietnam, China is political,” one source said. 
The approach has been effective. TikTok now counts Vietnam, a multi-billion dollar market for social media firms, as among its most profitable in Asia, according to sources with knowledge of the matter, while launching regular campaigns with authorities on safety and tourism. 
Back in West Java, Sandy Saputra aims to keep on flashing grins and goofing around on TikTok. 
“To me, this isn’t a job,” he said, before breaking away into another dance routine. “It’s a hobby that makes money.”

3710642,0,1,Breakingviews - Cox: Republicans mostly rant about fake socialism - Reuters,Donald Trump accepts Republican Party’s re-nomination as presidential candidate,"ZURICH (Reuters Breakingviews) - Pop into a gas station just about anywhere in south Florida to fill up the tank or snag a hot dog marinating in its own juices, and you may well be giving Maximo Alvarez your business. Having fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba under Operation Peter Pan, which airlifted unaccompanied minors to the United States in the early 1960s, Alvarez founded Sunshine Gasoline Distributors in 1987. He now has 536 Exxon, Shell, Chevron, Mobil and Marathon outlets.  
Alvarez’s story is quintessentially American. That’s no doubt why he was chosen to address the first night of this week’s Republican National Convention, which ended on Thursday. The four days combined earnest testimonials about President Donald Trump’s achievements with venom-spitting vitriol about his opponents, all of it shellacked with the sort of reality-television varnish that launched Trump’s celebrity in the first place.  
When it comes to policies, the GOP was reticent about what another four years of Trump would bring. Speakers preferred to attack Democratic nominee Joe Biden. A vote for him, they said, was a vote for the sort of rack and ruin that, ironically, is on grim display in many U.S. cities today.   
Alvarez brought in one variety of this right at the beginning. Again and again, Biden was painted as a proponent or a dupe for the most evil of ideologies. To quote from Trump’s hour-long speech from the White House lawn on Thursday night, the former vice president is a “Trojan Horse for socialism”.   
The narrative may be compelling, but it is almost entirely fallacious. True, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders styles himself as a democratic socialist. But all that means is that he thinks the government should have a somewhat larger role in the economy than it does now. Most of the tiny group of scruffy true believers in actual Marxist-Leninist ideology think Sanders is just another centrist.   
Those real communists are right. Sanders and his backers call for policies that are considered tepid centre-left in every other developed economy: universal health care, stronger welfare programmes, and more redistributive taxes. Indeed, to most of America’s rich friends, allies and trading partners, the American socialism-versus-capitalism debate looks downright silly.  
Alvarez criticised the Castro regime for “false promises”, including “free education, free healthcare”. Yes, and so what? Castro was an economic disaster, but governments all over Europe, not to mention Canada and Japan, have provided better education and medical care for their people than the United States has. The systems have various names, but here’s a hint: the most right-wing major party in Germany proudly wears the name Christlich-Soziale Union, in English the Christian-Socialists.   
The speakers at the GOP convention seem to live in another world. “This election is a choice between the far-left Democratic Socialist agenda versus protecting and preserving the American dream,” railed Elise Stefanik, a New York congresswoman. Biden leads to the “path of socialism and decline,” said Vice President Mike Pence. “The Socialist Democrats have a different agenda that will dismantle our institutions, defund our police and destroy our economy,” contended House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. And on it went.  
Ah, but perhaps the Democrats are not like any of the European social democrats. Perhaps they look back to the true Reds like Rosa Luxemburg and Leon Trotsky. Maybe they embrace a programme of asset expropriation where the state controls the means of production, followed by the liquidation of the former ruling class and their bourgeois lackeys.   
Well, not exactly. In fact, not at all. Biden’s economic plan, including more government subsidies for university education and more accessible healthcare, is in line with the established practices of America’s peers.   
Truth is, anyone searching for an example of contemporary socialism need look no further than the Trump administration’s response to the current recession. After all, income redistribution is at the very heart of socialism. And the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES), which was passed by Congress and signed by Trump, provided $2.2 trillion of that. In other words, the government effectively “socialised” much of the income lost in Covid-19-related lockdowns.  
The quantity of Trump’s socialism was exceptional (another buzzword much on display this week), but not the approach. The United States socialises lots of losses. Taxes already pay for most education and healthcare, and the government keeps close control of many other crucial economic levers.   
As far as it goes, citizens are right to complain about the socialisation of the costs of some aspects of the current American way of life: the lost trust in law enforcement, rising civil unrest, and outsized losses of life from drug overdoses, obesity and gun violence. Voters might back a more positive socialised effort to deal with these problems. That’s Germany’s Angela Merkel, not Fidel Castro.   
If the American dream needs preserving, as Stefanik said, the Republican convention was a poor example of how to go about it. There were some upbeat moments, like the president’s pardoning of Jon Ponder, a convicted bank robber. Overall, though, the tone was one of anger and grievance, as in the sweaty lipped attacks of former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and of snarling, as in the speeches delivered by the president’s sons. It was just about the opposite of aspirational.   
Many Republicans mistrust the United Nations, but it would be good for them look at its international comparisons, published annually, of happiness in different nations. The statisticians look at social support systems, healthy life expectancy at birth, freedom to make life choices, generosity and perceptions of corruption.   
Despite its immense wealth, the United States ranked just 18th in the latest ranking. It lagged 12 European nations, including Great Britain, as well as New Zealand, Israel, Australia and Costa Rica, most of which have embraced some form of, whisper the word, socialism.

President Donald Trump accepts the Republican presidential nomination during the final night of the Republican National Convention, on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, on Thursday. (Doug Mills/The New York Times)US President Donald Trump has officially accepted the re-nomination of the Republican Party as its presidential candidate for the November elections, telling his fellow Americans that at no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas.
Trump, 74, in his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House amidst cheers from his supporters on Thursday night, said: “My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States.”
“I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years,” Trump said.
“In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history” quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity!? he said.
Party’s delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
Pence delivered his acceptance speech from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday. This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Addressing an audience of about 1,500 invited guests, Trump said that the Republican Party goes forward united, determined and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
Trump and Pence are being challenged by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin senator Kamala Harris.
Harris, 55, has scripted history by becoming the first African-American and Indian-origin person to be nominated as a vice presidential candidate by a major political party.
As per an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days from now is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump’s acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party, which gathers once in four years in one of the American cities to nominate its presidential candidate.
This year it was scheduled to be held in Charlotte in North Carolina. Due to the restrictions on social gatherings as a result of the coronaviruspandemic, the convention went into a virtual mode, with only essential official business being held in Charlotte.
Popular Indian-American politician Nikki Haley was the star speaker on Monday, the first day. First Lady Melania Trump addressed the convention from Rose Garden of the White House on Tuesday, while Pence delivered his acceptance speech on Wednesday.
Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who is also his presidential advisor, addressed the convention before him on Thursday night.
“He’s our commander-in-chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. He is our president, and my father, Donald J Trump,” Ivanka said.
His son Donald Trump Jr addressed the convention on Monday, while daughter Tiffney and other son Eric addressed the convention on Tuesday and daughter-in-law Lara on Wednesday. A group of protesters had gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House in advance of Trump’s speech.
Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, and his wife were among the special invitees on the South Lawns of the White House for Trump’s acceptance speech. Al Mason said it was amazing spectacular and full of enthusiasm never seen in the Democratic convention last week.

The chief minister also said all activities should be carried out while following the Covid-19 protocol, adding that the B.Ed (Bachelor of Education) entrance examination was conducted for five lakh candidates in the state on August 9 and there were no complaints about the Covid-19 infection during that exam.
The Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) should also conduct its examinations in a similar manner, he said. Adityanath was reviewing the Unlock-3 situation at a high-level meeting at his official residence in Lucknow on Friday.
Also read: 6 non-BJP states file review petition in SC for NEET, JEE postponement
The National Testing Authority (NTA), the nodal body to conduct examinations, and the central government plan to hold JEE-Main between September 1 and 6 and NEET on September 13. JEE-Main and NEET are for undergraduate engineering and medical aspirants, respectively.
A review petition was filed before the Supreme Court on Friday by ministers from six non-BJP-ruled states challenging an August 17 order of the Supreme Court which had allowed the central government to hold NEET and JEE in September despite the prevailing Covid-19 situation.
These six states are West Bengal, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Maharashtra.
Yogi Adityanath reiterated his directive for 1.50 lakh Covid-19 tests per day in the state.
All efforts should continue to break the chain of Covid-19, he said, adding that there should be an increase in medical testing with a special increase in the number of rapid antigen tests per day. The number of RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests per day should also go up and there should be an increase in the required manpower for the purpose, the chief minister directed officials.
He also said district magistrates should focus on pandemic work between 9 am to 10 am, inspect offices between 10 am and 11 am and redress grievances of people in their offices between 11 am and 1 pm.
The chief minister also asked additional chief secretaries/principal secretaries to carry out inspection of offices functioning under them. He said barring the employees on leave or those who were sick, 50 percent of attendance should be ensured in all the offices and action should be taken against those found absent at 9.30 am. Adityanath also said an inspection system should be implemented at the tehsil and development block levels. The same system should be followed by the police officers as well, he added.
“In the absence of district magistrates and subdivisional magistrates, any other responsible officer should follow the schedule at various levels,” he said.
Besides improving surveillance, the arrangements at the integrated command and control centres should be increased. People should be made aware of Covid-19 in such a manner that they did not feel afraid to come forward for treatment, he said.
Work on the paediatric institute coming up in Gorakhpur should be completed in time, he said. The chief minister noted that cases of malaria had been reported from some districts. He said special medical teams should be sent and necessary arrangements for medical treatment should be made available there.
Arrangements for the distribution of fertilisers should be smooth and monitored regularly, he said. He also directed officials to take action against sugar mills owners who are not clearing the dues of cane growers.
The distribution of relief and compensation to people in the flood-affected areas should be timely ensured, he said.","Students follow social distancing as they appear for an exam in Shimla. The petition by the opposition ministers said the top court failed to appreciate that the central government had enough time to ""establish at least one centre for every district for NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains), reported PTI.(Express Photo by Pradeep Kumar)Ministers of six opposition-ruled states Friday moved the Supreme Court seeking review of its order allowing the Centre to conduct NEET and JEE entrance exams this year amid the prevailing coronaviruspandemic situation.
The review plea, filed by ministers from West Bengal (Moloy Ghatak), Jharkhand (Rameshwar Oraon), Rajasthan (Raghu Sharma), Chhattisgarh (Amarjeet Bhagat), Punjab (B S Sidhu) and Maharashtra (Uday Ravindra Sawant), said the apex court order fails to satisfy safety and security concerns of the students who will be appearing for the exams.
In an order on August 17, the top court had dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the NEET and JEE, the medical and engineering entrance exams, scheduled to be held in September, saying that life cannot be stopped and the career of students cannot be put in jeopardy. Are you ready to waste one whole year? If exams are not held, wont it be a loss to the country? Justice Arun Mishra, heading a three-judge bench, had said while hearing the petition.
The apex court had dismissed the plea by one Sayantan Biswas and others seeking direction to National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts both the NEET and JEE exams, to postpone them after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured that all safeguards would be taken.
Terming the decision to go ahead with the exams irrational, the plea by the opposition ministers said the top court failed to appreciate that the central government had enough time to establish at least one centre for every district for NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) rather than having several centres in one district, news agency PTI reported.
The plea further stated that the mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or their willingness or their desire to attend physical exams. It also termed the August 17 order as “cryptic, non-speaking” and said it does not discuss the various aspects and complexities involved in a matter of this magnitude and complex nature.
The plea added that the two reasons given by the court “life must go on and students should not lose an academic year” do not constitute an authoritative and comprehensive judicial scrutiny of the issue.
“It is submitted that if the impugned order dated August 17, 2020 is not reviewed then grave and irreparable harm and injury would befall on the student community of our country and not only will the health, welfare and safety of the students/candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE examinations would stand imperilled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy in these COVID-19 pandemic times,” the petition said.
The review plea also comes two days after Congress chief Sonia Gandhi convened a meeting of opposition chief ministers, in which seven chief ministers decided to approach the Supreme Court seeking postponement of the JEE-NEET examinations in view of the pandemic.

Batting first, England initially struggled as they lost Jonny Bairstow to the fifth ball of the match, but fellow opener Banton struck five sixes in his knock as England reached 131-6 in 16.1 overs before the weather closed in. 
The umpires eventually called off play at just past 9pm local time with the outfield too wet to continue. 
Banton’s 42-ball knock accelerated England’s innings but Pakistan hit back to take four wickets for 14 runs. 
Imad Wasim and Shadab Khan both claimed two victims while Iftikhar Ahmed had captain Eoin Morgan lbw. Dawid Malan was run out for 23, England’s second-highest score. 
The second match in the series is on Sunday. (Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Ken Ferris)","Kolkata Knight Riders captain Dinesh Karthik on Thursday opened up on the big decision made by the franchise last year on not retaining explosive Australia batsman Chris Lynn. The right-handed opening batsman was bought by KKR first in 2014 auctions, and then he was later bought by the franchise for a whopping 9.6 crore in 2018 auctions.
Despite Lynn’s high stakes, KKR decided to let go of the opener last year. The batsman was picked straightaway at his base price of Rs 2 crore by Mumbai Indians at the auction in December. (IPL 2020 full coverage)
Speaking in a video uploaded on the KKR official website, Karthik explained the reasons behind KKR letting go of the batsman. 
“We had to let go of Lynn with a heavy heart, whatever time he spent with the franchise, he was an absolute gun,” he said.

“Such are the dynamics of the auction that you have to let go of some players, Lynn is somebody I am really fond off, he brings a lot to the table,” Karthik further added.
Meanwhile, the wicketkeeper-batsman also went on to praise England captain Eoin Morgan who was bought by KKR for Rs 5.25 crore and said that his experience in the middle will certainly help him.
“Eoin Morgan is there with us for this season, I have met him a couple of times, he is a gem of a guy, being a solid human being is something that everyone looks at, he is a World Cup-winning captain. 
“England is the best white-ball team in the world, I would try to learn from him, he has a great mind,” Karthik added.

3298708,0,1,"Explained: Covid-19 reaches the Great Andamanese, why is this worrying?",Indians seek out fortune tellers to fight COVID-19 blues,"A Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG), the Great Andamanese now number only 59.Nine members of the dwindling Great Andamanese tribe have tested Covid-19 positive, setting off alarm bells in the Union Territory. While the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have so far recorded 2,985 novel coronavirus cases, 676 of which are active, it is for the first time that cases are reported from among the five Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) living in the islands.
Besides the Great Andamanese, the other four PVTGs are Jarawas, Onges, Sentinelese and Shorn Pens. Among the five, the Great Andamanese are the only ones who visit and live in the capital city of Port Blair frequently. The PVTGs are communities that are more vulnerable among tribal groups, and are put under a special category by the government of India.
While five among the nine Great Andamanese who are infected are residents of Port Blair, four others live in the remote Strait Island that is reserved for the tribe.
Anthropologists classify the Great Andamanese as part of the Negrito tribes that inhabit isolated parts of Southeast Asia and the Andaman Islands. Linguists Anju Saxena and Lars Borin, in their book, Lesser-Known Languages of South Asia: Status and Policies, Case Studies and Applications of Information Technology, write that recent studies by geneticists indicate that the Andamanese are possibly related to the Negritos of the Malay peninsula and in the Philippines.
Originally, the Great Andamanese were ten distinct tribes, including the Jeru, Bea, Bo, Khora, and Pockiwar, each with its own separate language. In 1788, when the British first tried to colonise the islands, the Great Andamanese numbered between 5,000 and 8,000. However, several members of the tribe were killed in encounters with the British to protect their territories. Later, many were wiped out in epidemics brought in by the colonisers, such as measles, syphilis and influenza.
After the 1857 mutiny, the British government sent thousands of mutineers for life imprisonment in the Andamans. A penal colony was established for the purpose. The new phase of settlement caused the death of many Great Andamanese as they succumbed to diseases and imperialist policies.
In the 1860s, the British established an Andaman Home where they kept captured Great Andamanese. Hundreds of the tribe died from the disease and abuse in the home, and of 150 babies born there, none survived beyond the age of two, says a report in the Survival International, which is a human rights organisation campaigning for the rights of tribes.
By 1901, the population of the Great Andamanese was down to 625. By the 1930s, the number had further gone below 100. In 1970, the Indian government removed the remaining Great Andamanese to the Strait Island. At present, only about 59 members of the community survive — 34 live in the Strait Island, the rest are in Port Blair.
The language of the Great Andamanese, Sare, has largely been lost, with the last surviving speaker dying earlier this year. The tribe now speaks mostly Hindi.
Major factors contributing to the diminishing population of the Great Andamanes include environmental disturbances, contagious diseases as a result of contact with city dwellers, and a high mortality rate assisted by addictions to alcohol, tobacco and opium, write Saxena and Borin.
Unlike the other PVTGs in the Andamans, the Great Andamanese are in contact with the general population since they visit Port Blair frequently, thereby making them more vulnerable to Covid-19.

For all the latest Explained News, download Indian Express App.","NEW DELHI (Reuters) - In his golden-hued office, decked out with peacock feathers and crystal balls, Indian mystic healer and astrologer Sanjay Sharma is busy offering his clients a peek into their future as the COVID-19 pandemic has muddied their present. 
“Right now people are really frightened about their future,” said Sharma, with flowing hair and a big vermilion dot on his forehead, as smouldering incense sticks spread their fragrance over an Apple laptop on his desk. 
“How will they survive? Will they have their jobs or not? Will their business survive or not,” he added. 
Indians are flocking to astrologers, tarot card readers and faith healers as they seek to know what lies ahead and find solutions to current health, financial and mental problems in a country where coronavirus cases have rocketed to 3.3 million - the third-highest in the world - with more than 60,000 deaths. 
“Whenever our mind is really disturbed and we feel anxious, we come here,” said Anju Devi, 52, who asked Sharma about her son’s dwindling business and the prospects of her daughter’s marriage. “Those who are in depression and taking medicines, they feel uplifted after coming here and it helps them come out of those situations.” 
Indian astrologers, palm readers, numerologists and tarot card readers are estimated to generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue. Charges vary from 100 rupees ($1.50) for a quick session with a palmist to several thousand rupees for a long session with a popular spiritual guide. 
Ajay Bhambi, a well-known astrologer and spiritual consultant to politicians, Bollywood stars and professional cricketers, said his business had risen 40% since the COVID-19 outbreak. 
“You keep the hopes alive and see what is exactly stored for them in future,” said Bhambi, a regular on Indian TV networks. “If I see a little ray, then I can create a better picture for them.” 
He predicted India’s COVID-19 crisis would significantly improve from March onward. 
To be sure, not every mystic is flooded with customers. For example, Kripajyoti Nisha Singla, a cosmic healer who also practices hypnotherapy, said she has cancelled sessions because of a lack of demand. 
“The energies which I got was that people were saving money,” Singla said. “Everyone’s very concerned about their finances, very uncertain about how they are going to survive” if the coronavirus crisis extends.

8242924,0,1,"US Election 2020: Donald Trump to attack Joe Biden as US confronts coronavirus, anti-racism protests",Democrat Harris says Wisconsin officer should be charged: NBC - Reuters,"President Donald Trump prepared to attack Democratic rival Joe Biden in front of a large crowd on the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday, as the United States struggles to address the coronavirus pandemic and a wave of anti-racism protests.
Trailing in national opinion polls less than 10 weeks before the Nov. 3 election, Trump will accept his party's nomination on the Republican National Convention's final night with a speech asserting that a Biden victory would only worsen the crises besieging the country.
""At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" Trump was expected to say, according to excerpts provided to Reuters ahead of the evening.
""We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years,"" he would say, referring to Biden's career as a U.S. senator and vice president.
Though an incumbent seeking a second four-year term, Trump remains a self-styled outsider, an approach that won him the White House, his first elected office, in 2016 on a promise to end the crime and violence he said was afflicting the country.
His convention's first three nights focused heavily on trying to convince Americans that Democrats, not the Trump administration, are to blame for the racial strife convulsing U.S. cities. Several speakers accused Biden of wanting to defund the police, even though he has rejected that position.
At a fundraiser on Thursday, Biden, 77, said Trump, 74 had used the specter of violence as a ""political strategy,"" rather than actually aiming to address it. Democrats formally nominated Biden at a convention last week.
""Donald Trump keeps saying it won't be safe in Joe Biden's America,"" he said. ""Their proof? The violence you're seeing is in Donald Trump's administration, Donald Trump's America. Did they forget who's president?""
Trump's decision to speak from the White House lawn to an expected crowd of more than 1,000 has drawn criticism that he is using the official residence for partisan purposes and ignoring the risk of coronavirus transmission.
Hours before Trump's speech, a large crowd assembled in white chairs, with little evidence of social distancing or face masks, despite health experts' recommendations. The coronavirus prompted both political parties to scale back their conventions and make events mostly virtual.
The Trump campaign said it had taken appropriate health precautions.
About 300 anti-Trump protesters gathered on Black Lives Matter Plaza nearby, playing music and dancing ahead of Trump's speech.
NATION UNDER SIEGE
More than 180,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus - more than any other country, according to a Reuters tally - amid a fresh wave of protests over the latest high-profile police shooting of a Black American.
In Kenosha, Wisconsin, relative calm returned after three nights of civil strife ending on Tuesday - including arson, vandalism and deadly shootings - sparked by a police shooting that paralyzed a Black man.
Trump, a former New York real estate developer, is seeking to turn around a re-election campaign that has been largely overshadowed by a health crisis that has put millions of Americans out of work.
While his approval rating among Republican voters remains high, dissent is mounting within the party. In three open letters being published on Thursday and Friday, Biden won endorsements from more than 160 people who worked for Republican former President George W. Bush or for past Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, the New York Times and Politico reported.
Earlier this week, 27 former Republican lawmakers endorsed Biden while the Lincoln Project, among the most prominent Republican-backed groups opposing Trump, said a former Republican Party head had joined it as a senior adviser.
Thursday's program aimed to counterbalance those defections, featuring a video showcasing former Democratic voters who say they now support Trump and remarks from U.S. Representative Jeff Van Drew, who abandoned the Democratic Party to join the Republicans after voting against Trump's impeachment this year.
""Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,"" he said.
FIREWORKS SPECTACLE
Trump, a former reality television host, and his advisers have set up his speech with a producer's eye. His use of the White House as his backdrop has irked critics who say holding a political event there is a potential violation of the law.
Fireworks were expected over Washington's nearby monuments at the conclusion of Trump's speech.
The Republican convention has attracted fewer television viewers than its Democratic counterpart on two of its three nights so far, including on Wednesday, according to early Nielsen Media Research.
A total of 17.3 million people watched the third night of the mostly virtual Republican National Convention on Wednesday, according to Nielsen, fewer than the 22.8 million viewers for the third night of last week's Democratic convention.
Democrats have criticized Trump's aggressive response to demonstrations sparked by the May 25 Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, a Black man.
On Wednesday, Trump said he was sending federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after violent protests there following the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back.
Trump kicked off the week on Monday by accusing Democrats of seeking to steal the election by advocating for mail-in voting. His previous high-profile speeches have also emphasized grim themes, including his inaugural address in January 2017 that described ""American carnage.""","(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris said on Thursday that she believed the officer who shot 29-year-old Jacob Blake in Wisconsin should be charged with a crime. 
“I don’t have all the evidence,” Harris told NBC News in an interview scheduled to air on Friday, according to an excerpt. “Based on what I’ve seen it seems the officer should be charged,” Harris, a former attorney general of California, added.

7512164,0,1,"No masks. social distancing: At GOP's convention, Covid is largely ignored",Donald Trump accepts Republican Party’s re-nomination as presidential candidate,"It was a stunning scene in a country where parents and children have been laid to rest without their loved ones present, schools have gone to online-only learning and businesses have shut their doors to halt the spread of the coronavirus.
On Thursday night, about 1,500 people gathered on the South Lawn of the White House so President Donald Trump could accept his party's nomination for reelection in front of a roaring crowd.
Masks were not required and chairs were placed inches apart from one another, with no room for social distancing, in violation of endless public health recommendations.
Only those the White House expected to be in ""close proximity"" to the president and vice president had been tested for COVID-19.
As Trump has tried to push past a pandemic that has tanked the economy and threatened his reelection chances, GOP organisers have worked to stage a convention that puts the virus in the rear view mirror and highlights the nation's progress, even as it continues to spread.
More than 42,000 new cases were reported Wednesday and 2,700 more have died since the week began.
But few convention speakers made reference to the virus, while others have discussed it in the past tense.
It was awful. Health and economic impacts were tragic, said White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on the convention's second night. But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.
The display stands in jarring contrast with the Democrats, who dispensed with audiences at live speeches during their virtual convention last week.
Presidential nominee Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris also wore masks, even when they were outside and standing apart from one another.
Is coronavirus gone? Is COVID-19 gone? Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders asked Thursday on a call with reporters. I didn't see any masks or social distancing happening during the vice president's speech last night. So, the reality is, there is a lack of leadership here.
To be sure, the Republicans' event looked very different from past conventions. Because of the virus, the GOP cancelled what would have been mass gatherings drawing thousands to North Carolina or Florida, and they have been consulting with a coronavirus adviser. Indoor speeches were delivered without audiences. But outdoor events have featured guests.
That included a Rose Garden address Tuesday by first lady Melania Trump, who spoke about the toll of the virus, and Vice President Mike Pence's speech Wednesday, delivered in front of about 100 people, including Pence's family and wounded veterans, at Fort McHenry in Baltimore.
After Pence had spoken, a scene unfolded that seemed from a bygone era, as audience members moved from their chairs and gathered near the stage to greet him, Trump and their wives.
While the president and first lady appeared to keep their distance, Pence was seen shaking hands, exchanging fist bumps, and at one point accepting a small gift from an audience member. No one appeared concerned about social distancing. Few in the crowd were seen wearing masks. And some told reporters they had not been tested for the virus before attending the speech.
The White House and campaign refused to say how many in attendance at the events had been tested for the virus. White House spokesman Judd Deere said only that those in close proximity to the president and vice president are screened.
And while Washington, DC, mandates that masks be worn in public places, guidance sent to those invited to Thursday's event specified that masks would not be required on the South Lawn, though they would be needed upon arrival and in security screening areas and encouraged in high traffic areas including restrooms and hospitality spaces.
Guests were also asked to practice social distancing whenever possible and stay home if they were displaying coronavirus symptoms, had recently tested positive for the virus or had been in recent close contact with someone who had.
Robert G Darling, who served a physician to former President Bill Clinton and is the chief medical officer of the Patronus Medical Corp, said the group has been working with the RNC on the convention to make certain proper protocols are in place to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals at convention venues"".
He said those protocols are in line with city and federal guidelines and that health professionals have been on-site to make certain screening has been done on a consistent basis to ensure the convention meets the highest standards of public safety"".
But the refusal to abide by other widely accepted mitigation recommendations including those promoted by the president's own heath agencies confounded public health experts watching at home.
The president and the entire RNC, they had an opportunity to show the seriousness of this pandemic, which is the worst public health crisis in our lifetimes, and it's extremely concerning that only did they not discuss precautions like wearing masks and social distancing, they are going against all of our public health guidance,"" said Dr Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy at The George Washington University and the former health commissioner of Baltimore.

President Donald Trump accepts the Republican presidential nomination during the final night of the Republican National Convention, on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, on Thursday. (Doug Mills/The New York Times)US President Donald Trump has officially accepted the re-nomination of the Republican Party as its presidential candidate for the November elections, telling his fellow Americans that at no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas.
Trump, 74, in his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House amidst cheers from his supporters on Thursday night, said: “My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States.”
“I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years,” Trump said.
“In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history” quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity!? he said.
Party’s delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
Pence delivered his acceptance speech from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday. This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Addressing an audience of about 1,500 invited guests, Trump said that the Republican Party goes forward united, determined and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
Trump and Pence are being challenged by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin senator Kamala Harris.
Harris, 55, has scripted history by becoming the first African-American and Indian-origin person to be nominated as a vice presidential candidate by a major political party.
As per an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days from now is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump’s acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party, which gathers once in four years in one of the American cities to nominate its presidential candidate.
This year it was scheduled to be held in Charlotte in North Carolina. Due to the restrictions on social gatherings as a result of the coronaviruspandemic, the convention went into a virtual mode, with only essential official business being held in Charlotte.
Popular Indian-American politician Nikki Haley was the star speaker on Monday, the first day. First Lady Melania Trump addressed the convention from Rose Garden of the White House on Tuesday, while Pence delivered his acceptance speech on Wednesday.
Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who is also his presidential advisor, addressed the convention before him on Thursday night.
“He’s our commander-in-chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. He is our president, and my father, Donald J Trump,” Ivanka said.
His son Donald Trump Jr addressed the convention on Monday, while daughter Tiffney and other son Eric addressed the convention on Tuesday and daughter-in-law Lara on Wednesday. A group of protesters had gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House in advance of Trump’s speech.
Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, and his wife were among the special invitees on the South Lawns of the White House for Trump’s acceptance speech. Al Mason said it was amazing spectacular and full of enthusiasm never seen in the Democratic convention last week.

7719691,0,1,"Republicans rally behind Trump, say Biden no longer has any principles","Trump, Republicans attack Joe Biden amid coronavirus crisis, street protests","Top Republican party leaders Thursday night rallied behind President Donald Trump as they used the platform of Republican National Convention to launch a blistering attack on his Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden.
""The Democrats are urging you to vote for an obviously defective candidate. Biden has changed his principles so often, he no longer has any principles, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said in his address to the Republican National Convention before Trump delivered his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House.
""He's a Trojan Horse with Bernie (Sanders), AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), (Nancy) Pelosi, Black Lives Matter and his party's entire Left Wing hidden inside his body just waiting to execute their pro-criminal, anti-police policies, said the former New York City Mayor.
The whole unprecedented wave of lawlessness began with a truly just cause -- the unforgiveable police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Peaceful protests began all over the land. The condemnation of the killing was universal from President Trump to Democrat leaders, he said.
It seemed for a a few brief shining moments' like Democrat and Republican leaders would come together with a unified proposal to reduce police misconduct. This possibility was very dangerous to the Left, Giuliani said.
Biden and his fellow Democrats were widely criticized for not speaking up about the out-of-control violence plaguing Democrat cities in our country. Their silence was so deafening that it reveals an acceptance of this violence because they will accept anything they hope will defeat President Donald Trump, he said.
However, they are making this election a choice between the Democrat policies soft on crime against the Republican program of law and order. It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city, town or suburb, Giuliani said.
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said Joe Biden and Kamala Harris think this election is about the government. They're wrong. It's about you, not us. Your family and your future, he said.
Congressman Jeff Van Drew said that Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running the Democratic Party. the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president, he said.
Debbie Flood, the owner of a Wisconsin machine shop, alleged that Biden voted to normalize trade with China and helped pave the way for them to join the WTO, even though they were hurting American companies like hers.
Our President understands that the best solutions unleash the innovation of American entrepreneurs and the creativity of American workers. Joe Biden doesn't know anything about business. Or about creating jobs, she said.
He's spent 47 years in government. It is doubtful that he'll finally figure it out in year 48. He's pledged to raise our taxes and bring back excessive regulation, Flood said.
US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson said that Trump is the most pro-life President in our country's history. He will continue to fight for those who cannot yet speak, he said.
Our President, Donald J. Trump, believes in the people. He is one of us. He makes promises, and he keeps them. He is transparent, and we certainly know what he's thinking. He does not submit to political correctness or to its enforcers, the media. He is real, Carson said.
Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch said, ""You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America. You can have four more years of President Trump.""
Joe Biden won't stand up for America. Donald Trump will. So this November, let's stand with the president and vote to keep America great, Giuliani said.
(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump attacked Democratic rival Joe Biden in front of a large crowd on the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday, as Republicans warned of a lawless and dangerous America if Biden wins the November election.
Trailing in national opinion polls, Trump accepted his party's nomination on the Republican National Convention's final night with a speech asserting that a Biden victory would only worsen the crises besieging the country.
""At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" Trump said. ""This election will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny.""
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, Trump delivered his remarks in front of more than 1,000 people, standing in front of dozens of American flags and basking in chants of ""Four more years!"" and ""U.S.A.!""
The made-for-television scene - befitting the first reality TV host to serve as president - stood in marked contrast to Biden's acceptance speech last week, which was broadcast live from a largely empty arena in a nod to the disease.
Trump's decision to speak from the White House lawn drew criticism that he was using the official residence for partisan purposes. The crowd, seated in white chairs inches apart, showed little evidence of social distancing or face masks despite health experts' recommendations.
The coronavirus prompted both political parties to scale back their conventions and make events mostly virtual. The Trump campaign said it had taken appropriate health precautions.
Though an incumbent seeking a second four-year term, Trump remains a self-styled outsider, an approach that won him the White House, his first elected office, in 2016 on a promise to end the crime and violence he said was afflicting the country.
With the country reeling from the pandemic and a wave of anti-racism protests, several speakers on Thursday argued that state and city Democratic leaders, not the Trump administration, were to blame for the racial strife convulsing U.S. cities, including Kenosha, Wisconsin, where this week police shot and paralyzed a Black man.
""It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessnesss to your city, to your town, to your suburb,"" said former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a close Trump confidant. Like other Republicans, Giuliani falsely accused Biden of embracing calls to ""defund the police,"" a position the Democrat has rejected.
As the night unfolded, Biden struck back on Twitter, writing, ""When Donald Trump says tonight you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump's America?""
NATION UNDER SIEGE
More than 180,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus - more than any other country, according to a Reuters tally - amid a fresh wave of protests over the latest high-profile police shooting of a Black American.
In Kenosha, relative calm returned after three nights of civil strife ending on Tuesday, including arson, vandalism and deadly shootings.
Trump, a former New York real estate developer, is seeking to turn around a re-election campaign that has been largely overshadowed by a health crisis that has put millions of Americans out of work.
While his approval rating among Republican voters remains high, dissent is mounting within the party. In three open letters being published on Thursday and Friday, Biden won endorsements from more than 160 people who worked for Republican former President George W. Bush or for past Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, the New York Times and Politico reported.
Earlier this week, 27 former Republican lawmakers endorsed Biden while the Lincoln Project, among the most prominent Republican-backed groups opposing Trump, said a former Republican Party head had joined it as a senior adviser.
Thursday's program aimed to counterbalance those defections, featuring a video showcasing former Democratic voters who say they now support Trump and remarks from U.S. Representative Jeff Van Drew, who abandoned the Democratic Party to join the Republicans after voting against Trump's impeachment this year.
""Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,"" he said.
The program also included several emotional appeals, including from the parents of Kayla Mueller, an aid worker who died after being held captive for months by Islamic State militants in Syria. The Mueller parents said they blamed the Obama administration for failing to rescue Mueller.
The Republican convention has attracted fewer television viewers than its Democratic counterpart on two of its three nights so far, including on Wednesday, according to early Nielsen Media Research.
A total of 17.3 million people watched the third night of the mostly virtual Republican National Convention on Wednesday, according to Nielsen, fewer than the 22.8 million viewers for the third night of last week's Democratic convention.
Trump kicked off the week on Monday by accusing Democrats of seeking to steal the election by advocating for mail-in voting. His previous high-profile speeches have also emphasized grim themes, including his inaugural address in January 2017 that described ""American carnage.""",https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/republicans-rally-behind-trump-say-biden-no-longer-has-any-principles-120082800144_1.html,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/trump-republicans-attack-joe-biden-amid-coronavirus-crisis-street-protests/articleshow/77796034.cms

Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration. 
Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: ""Joe Biden is not the saviour of America's soul."" 
""He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness."" 
""Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history,"" Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate. 
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election. 
""Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs,"" Trump alleged. 
During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). 
Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered. 
""This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" he said. 
""This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades,"" he said. 
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens. 
""And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it,"" he said. 
Referring to the last week's Democrat National Convention, Trump said that Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. 
""So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?"" he asked. 
""In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history,"" he said. 
Trump alleged that for 47 years, Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain - and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands. 
""Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars,"" he alleged. 
""Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defence,"" he said. 
Trump alleged that as vice president Biden supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. 
""He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing (Qasem) Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as ""a positive development"" for America and the world. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win,"" he said. 
""China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused,"" Trump said. 
He called Biden a Trojan horse for socialism. 
""Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden's America,"" he said, referring to violent protests there. 
On November 3, he urged his countrymen to send the Democrats led by Biden a thundering message they will never forget! ""Joe Biden is weak"".

Pence delivered his acceptance speech from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday. This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.

Trump's acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party, which gathers once in four years in one of the American cities to nominate its presidential candidate.
This year it was scheduled to be held in Charlotte in North Carolina. Due to the restrictions on social gatherings as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the convention went into a virtual mode, with only essential official business being held in Charlotte.
Popular Indian-American politician Nikki Haley was the star speaker on Monday, the first day. First Lady Melania Trump addressed the convention from Rose Garden of the White House on Tuesday, while Pence delivered his acceptance speech on Wednesday.
Trump's daughter Ivanka, who is also his presidential advisor, addressed the convention before him on Thursday night.
He's our commander-in-chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. He is our president, and my father, Donald J Trump, Ivanka said.
His son Donald Trump Jr addressed the convention on Monday, while daughter Tiffney and other son Eric addressed the convention on Tuesday and daughter-in-law Lara on Wednesday. A group of protesters had gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House in advance of Trump's speech.
Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, and his wife were among the special invitees on the South Lawns of the White House for Trump's acceptance speech.

Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, and his wife were among the special invitees on the South Lawns of the White House for Trump’s acceptance speech. Al Mason said it was amazing spectacular and full of enthusiasm never seen in the Democratic convention last week.

For a man on the edge of history, President Donald Trump sounded calm and relaxed. If he believes that he is on the verge of losing, he betrayed no sign of it. Instead, he trotted out one of his favorite polls, boasted about his popularity with Republican voters and talked about his conventions television ratings.
His presidency, he declared in an interview this week, has produced an incredible result. The stock markets are pretty amazing, the Republican National Convention has been very successful, and he has done a very good job of handling the coronaviruspandemic even though more than 180,000 Americans are dead. At the same time, he said, he has endured terrible things by his maniac opponents.
After nearly four years in office, Trump heads into the fall campaign with a striking blend of braggadocio and grievance, a man of extremes who claims one moment to have accomplished more than virtually any other president even as he complains moments later that he has also suffered more than any of them. He inhabits a world of his own making, sometimes untethered from the reality recognized by others. He has imposed his will on Washington and the world like no one else.
While previous presidents evolved in office as they learned the mechanisms of power and adjusted their goals by the time they claimed renomination, Trump remains the same polarizing, dominating force of nature who got up four years ago and asserted that I alone can fix it. He has not tempered with age nor bent to convention nor been chastened by impeachment. He says he still considers himself an outsider even while occupying the highest office in the land.
In the course of a 40-minute telephone call Wednesday, Trump struggled to describe how he had changed. I think Ive just become more guarded than I was four years ago, he offered, a curious notion for the least-guarded man to sit in the Oval Office in a lifetime. I think I really am a little bit more circumspect.
By that he seemed to mean that he had hardened after the many investigations and political attacks that have characterized his presidency. But he is not one for introspection. How would he be different in a second term? Really not much at all. I think Id be similar, he said. Which is exactly what his supporters want and his opponents fear.
Beyond more of the same, he has strained lately to define what his second-term agenda would be. Asked at various points, even by friendly interviewers on Fox News, he has offered meandering answers. His fellow Republicans seem no more certain. They therefore dispensed with a party platform altogether, opting instead for a simple resolution of loyalty to the president.
In the interview, Trump rattled off a list of what he has done and would continue to do, like increasing military spending, cutting taxes, eliminating regulations, reinforcing the border and appointing conservative judges.
But so I think; I think it would be; I think it would be very, very; I think wed have a very, very solid; we would continue what were doing; wed solidify what weve done, and we have other things on our plate that we want to get done, he said.
If he does win, his agenda to a significant degree may be set by external forces. He faces three overlapping crises buffeting the United States the pandemic that still kills roughly 1,000 people every day, the resulting economic slowdown that idled another 1 million people just last week and the unrest touched off by a string of police shootings of Black Americans, most recently in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Trump has all but put the pandemic behind him while arguing that he is best suited to rebuild the economy. In responding to the debate over racial justice, he has characteristically sought confrontation rather than calm, disparaging the Black Lives Matter movement, blaming street violence on what he calls radical Democrats and presenting himself as a stalwart defender of police.
Four years after his against-the-odds victory, he has claimed the nomination as the undisputed master of a party whose establishment did not want him. Those who stood against him have since been purged or have departed or have defected to former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee. It has given Trump a unified convention and a party remade in his image to the delight of supporters who see him as their champion against an entitled, politically correct elite.
Hes going to be accepting the nomination as somebody who previously was an outsider doing a hostile takeover of the party, Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, said last week in an interview. Hes still an outsider, but hes built a band of outsiders with him. The hostile takeover he started four years ago is now complete.
The hostile takeover may be over, but the hostility is not. Trump hardly goes a day without getting into a battle on Twitter or on camera with some perceived foe. While many see him as the instigator, he sees himself as the victim.
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he once asked Trump how he bore the attacks and accusations. You get it every single second of every single day, he recalled telling the president. And he said, Well, Jim, what are you going to do? Are you going to quit? Youve got to just keep fighting.
Anyone who has watched the arc of Trumps career in business, entertainment and politics should hardly be surprised. The thrice-married scion of a real estate family loved nothing more than a splashy ribbon-cutting and a sizzling tabloid item. As a reality television star, he moved beyond his bankruptcies to rebrand himself as the emblem of success. At every stage, he courted controversy, played on racial divisions and brushed off multiple accusations of sexual misconduct, including even lewd descriptions of women caught on tape.
He arrived at the White House in January 2017 as the first president never to have served a day in political office or the military and had little time for business as usual or even the traditions and laws that bind a commander in chief. After a lifetime as a smash-mouth celebrity, he became a smash-mouth president. At 74, he turns to the same litany of political tactics he always has, just as he relies on the same vocabulary over and over (tremendous, incredible, nasty, believe me, winning, loser, disgusting, disgrace).
At his first Republican National Convention, Trump called himself the law-and-order candidate, much as he planned to do again Thursday night. When it looked like he would lose in 2016, he claimed the election was being rigged, a word he recycled this year while trailing Biden in the polls. Just this week, he challenged Biden to take a drug test, much as he demanded that his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, do last time.
Trumps advisers said his refusal to bow to the Washington establishment distinguished him from the rest of the political class. If you think about it, Washington usually absorbs people, Kushner said. They come to town, and they go to the cocktail parties, and they go to the donor circles. Trump is one of the few people who hasnt changed.
Instead of trying to change to get along with people, Kushner added, hes doubled and tripled down on the promises that hes made, and I think he has more conviction. Theres not a single policy where you have a question about where he stands.
Trump has refused to adapt to the presidency, forcing it to adapt to him. When he took over, he started his days in the Oval Office around 9 a.m., but then complained to aides that he was working 12 hours a day and that this is way too much. Schedulers changed the routine so that his first meeting in the Oval Office rarely starts before 11 a.m., letting him watch television and make calls from the residence in the morning.
His staff grows frustrated when he sometimes does not show up until 11:30 a.m. or even later. But he has little respect for the schedule, turning a 15-minute meeting into a 45-minute session. When he has had enough, he bangs his open-palmed hands on his desk twice to signal that a meeting is over.
The presidents free-form style leaves aides scrambling. While phone calls with previous presidents were highly orchestrated affairs, Trump loves nothing more than to spontaneously call friends, lawmakers or people he just saw on Fox News.
Certain allies have instant access. When Fox media mogul Rupert Murdoch once called while Trump was on the phone with his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, his secretary, Madeleine Westerhout, asked if she should tell Murdoch that the president would call back. Trump erupted like Mount St. Helens, Westerhout recalled in a new memoir. Never put Rupert Murdoch on hold! he shouted. Never!
He lashes out at whoever is on hand even if they have nothing to do with whatever angers him, Westerhout wrote in an otherwise admiring book in which she praises him as a generous boss. Aides cringe when they have to deliver bad news. I really dont want to go in there, she recalled Sarah Huckabee Sanders, then the press secretary, telling her. Please dont make me. When the president needed bucking up, Westerhout would arrange a call with his friend, Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots who has been charged with solicitation of prostitution.
Trump burns through staff faster than any president has in modern times. He has had four chiefs of staff, four national security advisers and four press secretaries in less than four years. Some of his harshest critics are people who once worked for him and emerge with tales of an erratic, reckless president who lies profusely, has trouble processing information and subordinates national interest to self interest, as John Bolton, his former national security adviser, wrote in his own book.
Trump casts that as a failing of his former aides, not him. In looking back at what he would have done differently, he identified personnel. I think its mostly people. I wouldnt have used certain people, he said. You have people that sometimes you think theyre going to be great, and they turn out to be terrible, and sometimes you think theyre going to be terrible, and they turn out to be good.
Lately, some of the harshest criticism has come from relatives. His niece Mary Trump wrote a scathing book about him and produced recordings she secretly made of the presidents sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, calling him a man with no principles and denouncing his lying.
In the interview this week, Donald Trump complained that the tapes were released just as he was presiding over a funeral for his brother, Robert Trump, but otherwise did not respond to his sisters criticism. That was a very sad its a sad moment, he said. Hey, it is what it is.
But Trump rejected the portrayal of him as a lazy, television-obsessed president. Just the opposite, he said. I dont watch very much TV. Nobody knows what I do. He said, I work very long hours, actually, very long hours, probably longer than just about anybody. And I think more importantly, I think I work effectively.
His own circuitous train of thought, though, sometimes ends up taking his listeners on unpredictable journeys. When asked at first about the aides criticism, he wandered into a discussion of the convention audience (I looked at the Fox ratings) and resentment at attacks on his response to the virus (we havent been treated properly on that).
He has no second thoughts about the most critical decisions of his presidency. The pandemic was the fault of China. If he had it to do over again, he said, he would have ensured the country had more medical gear stockpiled, but he offered no regrets for playing down the virus and insisted that his push to reopen society in the spring was the right one despite the cascade of death that followed. I think it was a good decision because look at how our economy is going up, Trump said.
He rarely connects with those who have lost loved ones in the pandemic. The morning after his wife, Melania Trump, offered empathy at the convention, he acknowledged that many have asked why he does not. I know, I understand that, he said. I do read that a lot and see that a lot. But I feel tremendous sorrow and grief for the this should have never happened. Even as he said he felt empathy, he could not sustain it for even a full sentence before pivoting to whom to blame.
His worst moments since taking office, he said, were the day he was impeached unfairly in his mind and the night that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., cast the key vote dooming a Republican effort to revoke President Barack Obamas health care program. He acknowledged at the time that the job was harder than he had expected.
Now he says it is harder because of the attacks he endures. Its harder because Ive had two jobs, he said being president and I have to also constantly defend myself from a group of maniacs that are totally, that have, you know, that have gone totally off the tracks.
Given that, did he ever think about not running for a second term? I never even considered that, he said. He said he was ready for four more years. I feel good. I think I feel better than I did four years ago.

For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, accepting the Republican nomination for a second term, said on Thursday that he alone stands as a bulwark against the forces of socialism, anarchy and extremism that his Democratic rival Joe Biden would champion if elected in November. 
Speaking from the White House South Lawn despite criticism he was using the executive residence as a political prop, Trump asserted that a Biden victory would only worsen the crises besieging the country. 
“This election will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny.” Trump said on the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention. “This election will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans, or whether we give free rein to violent anarchic agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens.” 
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, Trump delivered his remarks in front of more than 1,000 people, standing in front of dozens of American flags and basking in chants of “Four more years!” and “U.S.A.!” 
Though an incumbent seeking a second four-year term, Trump remains a self-styled outsider, an approach that won him the White House, his first elected office, in 2016 on a promise to end the crime and violence he said was afflicting the country. 
On Thursday, he and other Republican speakers argued that state and city Democratic leaders, not the Trump administration, were to blame for the racial strife convulsing U.S. cities, including Kenosha, Wisconsin, where this week police shot and paralysed a Black man. 
“No one will be safe in Biden’s America,” Trump said despite the surge of unrest during his watch. 
As the night unfolded, Biden struck back on Twitter, writing, “When Donald Trump says tonight you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump’s America?” 
The made-for-television scene - befitting the first reality TV host to serve as president - stood in marked contrast to Biden’s acceptance speech last week, which was broadcast live from a largely empty arena in a nod to the disease. 
The crowd, seated in white chairs inches apart, showed little evidence of social distancing or face masks despite health experts’ recommendations. 
The coronavirus prompted both political parties to scale back their conventions and make events mostly virtual. The Trump campaign said it had taken appropriate health precautions. 
In a reminder of the country’s divisions, attendees could hear anti-Trump protesters at nearby Black Lives Matter Plaza as he spoke. 
MORE THAN 180,000 DEATHS 
More than 180,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus - more than any other country, according to a Reuters tally - amid a fresh wave of protests over the latest high-profile police shooting of a Black American. 
In Kenosha, relative calm returned after three nights of civil strife ending on Tuesday, including arson, vandalism and deadly shootings. 
Trump, a former New York real estate developer, is seeking to turn around a re-election campaign that has been largely overshadowed by a health crisis that has put millions of Americans out of work. 
In his speech on Thursday, Trump repeated his assertion that China is to blame for the pandemic and promised to rebuild what Republicans have called the “greatest economy” in history. But opinion polls have shown most Americans are disappointed in his response to the coronavirus, which he played down for weeks. 
While his approval rating among Republican voters remains high, dissent is mounting within the party. In three open letters being published on Thursday and Friday, Biden won endorsements from more than 160 people who worked for Republican former President George W. Bush or for past Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, the New York Times and Politico reported. 
Earlier this week, 27 former Republican lawmakers endorsed Biden while the Lincoln Project, among the most prominent Republican-backed groups opposing Trump, said a former Republican Party head had joined it as a senior adviser. 
Thursday’s program aimed to counterbalance those defections, featuring a video showcasing former Democratic voters who say they now support Trump and remarks from U.S. Representative Jeff Van Drew, who abandoned the Democratic Party to join the Republicans after voting against Trump’s impeachment this year. 
“Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,” he said. 
The program also included several emotional appeals, including from the parents of Kayla Mueller, an aid worker who died after being held captive for months by Islamic State militants in Syria. The Mueller parents said they blamed the Obama administration for failing to rescue Mueller. 
The Republican convention has attracted fewer television viewers than its Democratic counterpart on two of its three nights so far, including on Wednesday, according to early Nielsen Media Research. 
A total of 17.3 million people watched the third night of the mostly virtual Republican National Convention on Wednesday, according to Nielsen, fewer than the 22.8 million viewers for the third night of last week’s Democratic convention. 
Trump kicked off the week on Monday by accusing Democrats of seeking to steal the election by advocating for mail-in voting. His previous high-profile speeches have also emphasized grim themes, including his inaugural address in January 2017 that described “American carnage.”

For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App.","President Donald Trump prepared to attack Democratic rival Joe Biden in front of a large crowd on the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday, as the United States struggles to address the coronavirus pandemic and a wave of anti-racism protests.
Trailing in national opinion polls less than 10 weeks before the Nov. 3 election, Trump will accept his party's nomination on the Republican National Convention's final night with a speech asserting that a Biden victory would only worsen the crises besieging the country.
""At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" Trump was expected to say, according to excerpts provided to Reuters ahead of the evening.
""We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years,"" he would say, referring to Biden's career as a U.S. senator and vice president.
Though an incumbent seeking a second four-year term, Trump remains a self-styled outsider, an approach that won him the White House, his first elected office, in 2016 on a promise to end the crime and violence he said was afflicting the country.
His convention's first three nights focused heavily on trying to convince Americans that Democrats, not the Trump administration, are to blame for the racial strife convulsing U.S. cities. Several speakers accused Biden of wanting to defund the police, even though he has rejected that position.
At a fundraiser on Thursday, Biden, 77, said Trump, 74 had used the specter of violence as a ""political strategy,"" rather than actually aiming to address it. Democrats formally nominated Biden at a convention last week.
""Donald Trump keeps saying it won't be safe in Joe Biden's America,"" he said. ""Their proof? The violence you're seeing is in Donald Trump's administration, Donald Trump's America. Did they forget who's president?""
Trump's decision to speak from the White House lawn to an expected crowd of more than 1,000 has drawn criticism that he is using the official residence for partisan purposes and ignoring the risk of coronavirus transmission.
Hours before Trump's speech, a large crowd assembled in white chairs, with little evidence of social distancing or face masks, despite health experts' recommendations. The coronavirus prompted both political parties to scale back their conventions and make events mostly virtual.

NATION UNDER SIEGE
More than 180,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus - more than any other country, according to a Reuters tally - amid a fresh wave of protests over the latest high-profile police shooting of a Black American.
In Kenosha, Wisconsin, relative calm returned after three nights of civil strife ending on Tuesday - including arson, vandalism and deadly shootings - sparked by a police shooting that paralyzed a Black man.
Trump, a former New York real estate developer, is seeking to turn around a re-election campaign that has been largely overshadowed by a health crisis that has put millions of Americans out of work.
While his approval rating among Republican voters remains high, dissent is mounting within the party. In three open letters being published on Thursday and Friday, Biden won endorsements from more than 160 people who worked for Republican former President George W. Bush or for past Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, the New York Times and Politico reported.
Earlier this week, 27 former Republican lawmakers endorsed Biden while the Lincoln Project, among the most prominent Republican-backed groups opposing Trump, said a former Republican Party head had joined it as a senior adviser.
Thursday's program aimed to counterbalance those defections, featuring a video showcasing former Democratic voters who say they now support Trump and remarks from U.S. Representative Jeff Van Drew, who abandoned the Democratic Party to join the Republicans after voting against Trump's impeachment this year.
""Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,"" he said.
FIREWORKS SPECTACLE
Trump, a former reality television host, and his advisers have set up his speech with a producer's eye. His use of the White House as his backdrop has irked critics who say holding a political event there is a potential violation of the law.
Fireworks were expected over Washington's nearby monuments at the conclusion of Trump's speech.
The Republican convention has attracted fewer television viewers than its Democratic counterpart on two of its three nights so far, including on Wednesday, according to early Nielsen Media Research.
A total of 17.3 million people watched the third night of the mostly virtual Republican National Convention on Wednesday, according to Nielsen, fewer than the 22.8 million viewers for the third night of last week's Democratic convention.
Democrats have criticized Trump's aggressive response to demonstrations sparked by the May 25 Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, a Black man.
On Wednesday, Trump said he was sending federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after violent protests there following the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back.
Trump kicked off the week on Monday by accusing Democrats of seeking to steal the election by advocating for mail-in voting. His previous high-profile speeches have also emphasized grim themes, including his inaugural address in January 2017 that described ""American carnage.""",https://indianexpress.com/article/world/instead-of-evolving-as-president-trump-has-bent-the-job-to-his-will-6573006/,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-election-2020-donald-trump-to-attack-joe-biden-as-us-confronts-coronavirus-anti-racism-protests-5765431.html
7237692,0,1,Joe Biden's victory will endanger nation and destroy American greatness: Donald Trump,"US Election 2020: Donald Trump to attack Joe Biden as US confronts coronavirus, anti-racism protests","Washington: Seeking another four years in the White House, US President Donald Trump has slammed Democratic rival Joe Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness. 
Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration. 
Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: ""Joe Biden is not the saviour of America's soul."" 
""He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness."" 
""Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history,"" Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate. 
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election. 
""Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs,"" Trump alleged. 
During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). 
Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered. 
""This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" he said. 
""This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades,"" he said. 
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens. 
""And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it,"" he said. 
Referring to the last week's Democrat National Convention, Trump said that Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. 
""So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?"" he asked. 
""In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history,"" he said. 
Trump alleged that for 47 years, Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain - and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands. 
""Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars,"" he alleged. 
""Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defence,"" he said. 
Trump alleged that as vice president Biden supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. 
""He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing (Qasem) Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as ""a positive development"" for America and the world. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win,"" he said. 
""China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused,"" Trump said. 
He called Biden a Trojan horse for socialism. 
""Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden's America,"" he said, referring to violent protests there. 
On November 3, he urged his countrymen to send the Democrats led by Biden a thundering message they will never forget! ""Joe Biden is weak"". 
""He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.","President Donald Trump prepared to attack Democratic rival Joe Biden in front of a large crowd on the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday, as the United States struggles to address the coronavirus pandemic and a wave of anti-racism protests.
Trailing in national opinion polls less than 10 weeks before the Nov. 3 election, Trump will accept his party's nomination on the Republican National Convention's final night with a speech asserting that a Biden victory would only worsen the crises besieging the country.
""At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" Trump was expected to say, according to excerpts provided to Reuters ahead of the evening.
""We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years,"" he would say, referring to Biden's career as a U.S. senator and vice president.
Though an incumbent seeking a second four-year term, Trump remains a self-styled outsider, an approach that won him the White House, his first elected office, in 2016 on a promise to end the crime and violence he said was afflicting the country.
His convention's first three nights focused heavily on trying to convince Americans that Democrats, not the Trump administration, are to blame for the racial strife convulsing U.S. cities. Several speakers accused Biden of wanting to defund the police, even though he has rejected that position.
At a fundraiser on Thursday, Biden, 77, said Trump, 74 had used the specter of violence as a ""political strategy,"" rather than actually aiming to address it. Democrats formally nominated Biden at a convention last week.
""Donald Trump keeps saying it won't be safe in Joe Biden's America,"" he said. ""Their proof? The violence you're seeing is in Donald Trump's administration, Donald Trump's America. Did they forget who's president?""
Trump's decision to speak from the White House lawn to an expected crowd of more than 1,000 has drawn criticism that he is using the official residence for partisan purposes and ignoring the risk of coronavirus transmission.
Hours before Trump's speech, a large crowd assembled in white chairs, with little evidence of social distancing or face masks, despite health experts' recommendations. The coronavirus prompted both political parties to scale back their conventions and make events mostly virtual.
The Trump campaign said it had taken appropriate health precautions.
About 300 anti-Trump protesters gathered on Black Lives Matter Plaza nearby, playing music and dancing ahead of Trump's speech.

3692211,0,1,"‘Uttar Pradesh backs Centre’s decision to hold NEET, JEE’: CM Yogi Adityanath - Hindustan Times","NEET, JEE: 6 states seek review of SC order","Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said the state government supports Centre’s decision to conduct National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE).
The chief minister also said all activities should be carried out while following the Covid-19 protocol, adding that the B.Ed (Bachelor of Education) entrance examination was conducted for five lakh candidates in the state on August 9 and there were no complaints about the Covid-19 infection during that exam.
The Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) should also conduct its examinations in a similar manner, he said. Adityanath was reviewing the Unlock-3 situation at a high-level meeting at his official residence in Lucknow on Friday.
Also read: 6 non-BJP states file review petition in SC for NEET, JEE postponement
The National Testing Authority (NTA), the nodal body to conduct examinations, and the central government plan to hold JEE-Main between September 1 and 6 and NEET on September 13. JEE-Main and NEET are for undergraduate engineering and medical aspirants, respectively.
A review petition was filed before the Supreme Court on Friday by ministers from six non-BJP-ruled states challenging an August 17 order of the Supreme Court which had allowed the central government to hold NEET and JEE in September despite the prevailing Covid-19 situation.
These six states are West Bengal, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Maharashtra.
Yogi Adityanath reiterated his directive for 1.50 lakh Covid-19 tests per day in the state.
All efforts should continue to break the chain of Covid-19, he said, adding that there should be an increase in medical testing with a special increase in the number of rapid antigen tests per day. The number of RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests per day should also go up and there should be an increase in the required manpower for the purpose, the chief minister directed officials.
He also said district magistrates should focus on pandemic work between 9 am to 10 am, inspect offices between 10 am and 11 am and redress grievances of people in their offices between 11 am and 1 pm.
The chief minister also asked additional chief secretaries/principal secretaries to carry out inspection of offices functioning under them. He said barring the employees on leave or those who were sick, 50 percent of attendance should be ensured in all the offices and action should be taken against those found absent at 9.30 am. Adityanath also said an inspection system should be implemented at the tehsil and development block levels. The same system should be followed by the police officers as well, he added.
“In the absence of district magistrates and subdivisional magistrates, any other responsible officer should follow the schedule at various levels,” he said.
Besides improving surveillance, the arrangements at the integrated command and control centres should be increased. People should be made aware of Covid-19 in such a manner that they did not feel afraid to come forward for treatment, he said.
Work on the paediatric institute coming up in Gorakhpur should be completed in time, he said. The chief minister noted that cases of malaria had been reported from some districts. He said special medical teams should be sent and necessary arrangements for medical treatment should be made available there.
Arrangements for the distribution of fertilisers should be smooth and monitored regularly, he said. He also directed officials to take action against sugar mills owners who are not clearing the dues of cane growers.
The distribution of relief and compensation to people in the flood-affected areas should be timely ensured, he said.","NEW DELHI: A review petition has been filed by six opposition ruled state governments against an order of the Supreme Court dated August 17 vide which it had allowed the Centre to hold the National Eligibility cum Entrance test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) in September.
Cabinet Ministers of six states have sought a review. The States are: West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Rajasthan.
A Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra, on August 17, had dismissed pleas seeking deferment of JEE Main 2020 and NEET UG examinations which are slated to be held in September.
Pursuant to the August 17 order of the Apex Court, the National Testing Agency (NTA)- earlier this week- notified that the said entrance examination would be conducted as per the revised schedule with the NEET on September 13 and the JEE on September 16.
The review petitions now state the Supreme Courts judgment and the NTAs decision to conduct the said exams, in the midst of the pandemic, is ""flawed"".
The petitioners have contended that the said decision fails to ensure the safety, security and right to life of the student candidates appearing for the said exams.
The review petitions further state that the NTA has ignored the logistical difficulties in carrying the examinations on the proposed dates and also failed to balance the competing but equally crucial aspect of conducting the examination and safety of the students. The review petitioners have also raised the issue of lack of mandatory safeguards for carrying the examinations.
The review petitioners have stated that nearly 25 lakh students will appear for the examinations in the midst of the pandemic and at a time when the country has recorded over 3.31 million COVID-19 cases.
With JEE being proposed to be conducted in over 660 exam centres for 9.53 lakh students, roughly 1,443 students will be writing the exam per JEE centre and for the NEET UG exams, 15.97 lakh students are slated to appear in 3,843 centres, meaning that there will be 415 students per NEET exam centre, the pleas state.
The review petitions have been filed by the Cabinet Ministers of six states in their individual capacities.
These are Moloy Ghatak, Minister-in-Charge, Department of Labour &amp; E.S.I. (MB) Scheme and Departments of Law &amp; Judicial, West Bengal; Dr Rameshwar Oraon, Finance Minister, Jharkhand; Dr Raghu Sharma, Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Rajasthan; Amarjeet Bhagat, Indian Minister of Food, Civil supplies, Culture, Planning, Chhattisgarh; Balbir Singh Sidhu, Minister of Health and Family Welfare &amp; Labour, Punjab and Uday Ravindra Samant, Minister of Higher and Technical Education, Maharashtra.
Challenging the SC decision, the review petitioners have said that the Apex Court failed to appreciate that the Union Government had adequate time to establish at least one centre for every district for NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) rather than having several centres in one district. Having at least one centre per district would have minimised the inter-district long travel of the students and thereby reduced the chances of COVID-19 spread.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-backs-centre-s-decision-to-hold-neet-jee-cm-yogi-adityanath/story-9b0aQtItaOvwLf5hPK8dLN.html,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/neet-jee-exams-ministers-of-6-opposition-ruled-states-move-sc-seek-review-of-order/articleshow/77801986.cms
4674931,0,1,"Republican convention praise of Trump economy is risky strategy, poll highlights - Reuters",US Election 2020: Donald Trump accepts Republican Partys re-nomination as presidential candidate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans’ support for President Donald Trump’s management of the economy has slipped, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows, challenging a bedrock re-election argument laid out at the Republican National Convention this week. 
About 58% of respondents said the U.S. economy is on the wrong track in a survey taken August 19 through 25th. 
And for the first time this year, Trump’s net approval on economic issues dipped into negative territory, with 47% saying they approved of his stewardship of the American economy and 48% saying they disapproved. That is down from an approval margin of 14 percentage points in late March. 
While the poll shows Trump still has an edge with voters over Democratic opponent Joe Biden on the economy, the results highlight the risks the Republican Party is taking by leaning on memories of last year’s strong economy and arguing that Trump will easily be able to restore it. 
“Our economic choice is very clear. Do you want economic health, prosperity, opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation, recession and pessimism?” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said at the convention on Tuesday night. 
“Who do you trust to rebuild this economy?,” Vice President Mike Pence asked Wednesday night. “A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world?” 
BOUNCE AHEAD, BUT THEN WHAT? 
Looking to the fall, just as the U.S. witnessed a historic drop here in gross domestic product from April through June, Trump will be able to trumpet a record increase - equivalent to perhaps 25% on an annualized basis - when statistics are released in October covering the July to September period. 
Neither data point, products of a deliberate shutdown of the economy in March and the automatic impact of reopening from that sudden stop, say much about the economic fortunes of families and businesses during the first months of the pandemic, or in the weeks to come. 
The coronavirus health crisis, with nearly 6 million infected and over 175,000 Americans dead, is still raging. The onset of the conventional flu season is on the horizon, and an experiment underway in reopening schools and colleges is already leading to new spikes in infections. 
Consumer confidence, which can influence future economic activity, remains weak. The national unemployment rate at 10.2% in July is the highest in 39 years, and improvement seems to be slowing. Nearly 15 million Americans are receiving unemployment benefits, the highest on record and double the number hit during the 2007 to 2009 Great Recession. 
The blow has been received hardest among groups including blacks, Hispanics and women who benefited most from last year’s record low unemployment rate. Continued support among white women in particular will be critical to Trump’s electoral chances. 
TRUMP EDGE OVER BIDEN 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll found most voters would not currently back Biden on the economy. 
Trump’s team has been hammering Biden’s discussion of tax policies to pay for rising government debt due to the Trump administration’s earlier tax cuts. 
Among registered voters, Trump still has a five-point edge over Biden in who would be better to manage the economy. 
But the poll also found 30% of Republicans felt the economy was on the wrong track, the highest since February 2018 when Reuters/Ipsos started tracking the question. 
The poll gathered responses from 4,428 American adults, including 1,929 Democrats, 1,750 Republicans and 430 independents. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of between 2-5 percentage points. 
If the economic impact of the pandemic has been in some ways less severe than feared, with household spending returning to pre-pandemic levels and Americans boosting their savings, it is only because of massive government spending and a larger federal footprint in the economy. 
Both Republican and Democratic leaning economists feel much more federal help and a larger federal footprint will be needed to avoid a deeper slide this fall - steps that Trump would have to embrace even as he tries to brand Biden a “socialist.” 
The lapse of $600 a week unemployment benefits, the expiration of loans for small businesses, and the lack of help for state and local governments may in short order pull the rug from economic data that has been more positive than expected since a wave of business lockdowns and social distancing measures in April. 
A Census survey in July said reported “food insecurity” rose more than 20% early in the pandemic, reaching nearly 30 million. 
As former Fed chair Janet Yellen and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities senior adviser Jared Bernstein said in a New York Times column, a lot more people are hungry. 
Both have been briefing Biden on economic issues, and wrote that without further federal spending, “millions of needy Americans will suffer and the overall economy could degrade from its current slow rebound in growth to no growth at all.” 
Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Heather Timmons and Alistair Bell","US President Donald Trump has officially accepted the re-nomination of the Republican Party as its presidential candidate for the November elections, telling his fellow Americans that at no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas.
Trump, 74, in his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House amidst cheers from his supporters on Thursday night, said: My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States.
I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years, Trump said.

Party's delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
Pence delivered his acceptance speech from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday. This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Addressing an audience of about 1,500 invited guests, Trump said that the Republican Party goes forward united, determined and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
Trump and Pence are being challenged by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin senator Kamala Harris.
Harris, 55, has scripted history by becoming the first African-American and Indian-origin person to be nominated as a vice presidential candidate by a major political party.
As per an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days from now is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump's acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party, which gathers once in four years in one of the American cities to nominate its presidential candidate.
This year it was scheduled to be held in Charlotte in North Carolina. Due to the restrictions on social gatherings as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the convention went into a virtual mode, with only essential official business being held in Charlotte.
Popular Indian-American politician Nikki Haley was the star speaker on Monday, the first day. First Lady Melania Trump addressed the convention from Rose Garden of the White House on Tuesday, while Pence delivered his acceptance speech on Wednesday.

4783042,0,1,"US big tech dominates stock market after monster rally, leaving investors on edge",Facebook says Apple rejected its attempt to tell users about App Store fees,"BOSTON: US technology giants are increasingly dominating the stock market in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, even as they draw accusations of unfair business practices, and some investors fear the pump is primed for a tech-fueled sell-off.
The combined value of the S&amp;P 500's five biggest companies - Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp , Facebook Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc - now stands at more than $7 trillion, accounting for almost 25% of the index's market capitalization. That compares with less than 20% pre-pandemic.
The quintet's burgeoning share prices reflect a transition to an increasingly technology-driven economy that has been accelerated by the coronavirus outbreak, as doorways fill with Amazon packages, homebound families stream movies and friends commiserate on Facebook.
Yet the companies are drawing opposition. US lawmakers are accusing them of stifling competition, a charge also leveled in recent days against Apple by Epic Games, creator of the popular game Fortnite.
Some investors worry the companies powering this year's equity rally could become the market's Achilles' heel if a legal assault, a shift to undervalued names or a move higher in bond yields dries up appetite for technology stocks.
""People see these companies as winners and investors are willing to pay any price to own them,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. ""That's always a risk.""
LEGAL THREATOne potential threat comes from an array of investigations and legal actions.
The latest came Monday, when a federal judge temporarily blocked Apple from cutting off all the developer accounts of Epic Games, pending a full hearing on the issue. It was a partial win for Epic, which had called Apple's rules an anticompetitive abuse of power.
The standoff centers on Apple's App Store, which forms the centerpiece of a $46.3 billion-per-year services business that has helped buoy the company's share price.
The decision ""is just a first battle of many on the horizon,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""From a valuation perspective, there's clearly an overhang around antitrust.""
Wedbush nevertheless raised its target price for Apple on Wednesday to $700 a share in a ""bull case"" scenario, citing a ""once in a decade"" opportunity to take advantage of as many as 950 million potential iPhone upgrades worldwide.
Apple shares on Thursday closed at $500.04.
Still, this week's Apple court decision may be a taste of things to come for technology giants, whose influence has been one of the few issues capable of galvanizing bipartisan interest among lawmakers.
Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and Apple face a series of federal government probes into allegations that they unfairly defend their market share, with litigation against Alphabet possible later this year.
""These few behemoths dominate their industry and can set the rules of the global economy,"" said US Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who has been outspoken about antitrust issues. ""This kind of concentrated power is always dangerous.""
The opposition is a worry for investors hoping the companies will continue delivering robust growth that justifies their valuations.
Amazon said it operates in a ""fiercely competitive"" market, citing US Census Bureau data that only about 10% of US retail sales occur online.
Apple declined comment. The company previously said it competes vigorously against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other Android device makers in the smart phone markets.
Alphabet declined comment. It previously said it competes with Amazon, Microsoft, Comcast Corp, AT&amp;T Inc and many others.
Facebook and Microsoft had no immediate comment.
INVESTMENT DILEMMAFor some investors, the companies embody a dilemma that has dogged them at various times during the last decade. Many have found that cutting exposure to tech-related shares has limited portfolio performance over the long term.
The Big Five have seen their shares jump 22% or more to record highs this year, with Amazon soaring 86%. By comparison, the median stock performance across the S&amp;P 500 year-to-date is a 4% drop.
The companies' ""increased market share ... provides potentially huge opportunities supporting growth prospects over many years,"" said David Polak, equity investment director at $1.7 trillion Capital Group, which owns shares of big technology companies.
Still, some worry that a bad patch in the companies' widely owned shares could trigger violent swings in broader markets.
Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent report that the S&amp;P 500 ""has never been more dependent on the continued strength of its largest constituents.""
Another risk is a broad-based economic rebound boosting earnings of companies that have underperformed during the pandemic, potentially making their shares more competitive with tech stocks, said Edwin Jager, head of fundamental equities at hedge fund firm DE Shaw &amp; Co, which oversees more than $50 billion.
In addition, a sustained rise in bond yields could make growth stocks less attractive, Jager said. Longer-term Treasury yields hit multi-month highs on Thursday after the Federal Reserve announced a shift in monetary strategy.
A change of sentiment toward big tech could take a comparatively heavier toll on the shares of less profitable technology companies that have rallied alongside the market's giants.

""It rarely ever is.""","Facebook Inc told Reuters that Apple Inc rejected its attempt to tell users the iPhone maker would take a 30% cut of sales in a new online events feature, forcing Facebook to remove the message to get the tool to users.

""Now more than ever, we should have the option to help people understand where money they intend for small businesses actually goes.

7424700,0,1,White House's Kushner says he will reach out to NBA superstar LeBron James - Reuters.com,"US Election 2020: Donald Trump to attack Joe Biden as US confronts coronavirus, anti-racism protests","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House Adviser Jared Kushner on Thursday said he would reach out to basketball superstar LeBron James following an NBA player boycott to protest racial injustice in the wake of a police shooting that paralyzed a Black man in Wisconsin. 
The National Basketball Association postponed all three of its playoff games on Wednesday after the Milwaukee Bucks boycotted Game 5 of their series against the Orlando Magic to protest racial injustice, triggering similar moves across other sports. 
The action by the Bucks, a team based in Wisconsin, came in the aftermath of the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in the Wisconsin city of Kenosha on Sunday. 
“I think that it’s nice that they’re standing up for the issue, but I’d like to see them start moving into concrete solutions that are productive. And again, President Trump in this White House is willing to work with them,” Kushner said in an interview with Politico. 
Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, added that the White House would be happy to talk with James and that he would reach out to the Los Angeles Lakers star on Thursday. James has been critical of Trump and previously accused the Republican president, who is seeking re-election on Nov. 3, of trying to use sports to divide Americans. 
James, a four-time NBA Most Valuable Player, wrote on Twitter: “WE DEMAND CHANGE. SICK OF IT.” 
In the Kenosha shooting, Rusten Sheskey, a seven-year police veteran, fired seven times at Blake’s back, striking him four times, as he walked away from police and entered his car. Blake survived despite injuries to his spine and multiple organs, and he may be permanently paralyzed, his family lawyers said. 
Reporting by Daphne Psaledakis; Editing by Will Dunham and Chizu Nomiyama","President Donald Trump prepared to attack Democratic rival Joe Biden in front of a large crowd on the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday, as the United States struggles to address the coronavirus pandemic and a wave of anti-racism protests.
Trailing in national opinion polls less than 10 weeks before the Nov. 3 election, Trump will accept his party's nomination on the Republican National Convention's final night with a speech asserting that a Biden victory would only worsen the crises besieging the country.
""At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" Trump was expected to say, according to excerpts provided to Reuters ahead of the evening.
""We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years,"" he would say, referring to Biden's career as a U.S. senator and vice president.
Though an incumbent seeking a second four-year term, Trump remains a self-styled outsider, an approach that won him the White House, his first elected office, in 2016 on a promise to end the crime and violence he said was afflicting the country.
His convention's first three nights focused heavily on trying to convince Americans that Democrats, not the Trump administration, are to blame for the racial strife convulsing U.S. cities. Several speakers accused Biden of wanting to defund the police, even though he has rejected that position.
At a fundraiser on Thursday, Biden, 77, said Trump, 74 had used the specter of violence as a ""political strategy,"" rather than actually aiming to address it. Democrats formally nominated Biden at a convention last week.
""Donald Trump keeps saying it won't be safe in Joe Biden's America,"" he said. ""Their proof? The violence you're seeing is in Donald Trump's administration, Donald Trump's America. Did they forget who's president?""
Trump's decision to speak from the White House lawn to an expected crowd of more than 1,000 has drawn criticism that he is using the official residence for partisan purposes and ignoring the risk of coronavirus transmission.
Hours before Trump's speech, a large crowd assembled in white chairs, with little evidence of social distancing or face masks, despite health experts' recommendations. The coronavirus prompted both political parties to scale back their conventions and make events mostly virtual.
The Trump campaign said it had taken appropriate health precautions.
About 300 anti-Trump protesters gathered on Black Lives Matter Plaza nearby, playing music and dancing ahead of Trump's speech.
NATION UNDER SIEGE
More than 180,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus - more than any other country, according to a Reuters tally - amid a fresh wave of protests over the latest high-profile police shooting of a Black American.
In Kenosha, Wisconsin, relative calm returned after three nights of civil strife ending on Tuesday - including arson, vandalism and deadly shootings - sparked by a police shooting that paralyzed a Black man.
Trump, a former New York real estate developer, is seeking to turn around a re-election campaign that has been largely overshadowed by a health crisis that has put millions of Americans out of work.
While his approval rating among Republican voters remains high, dissent is mounting within the party. In three open letters being published on Thursday and Friday, Biden won endorsements from more than 160 people who worked for Republican former President George W. Bush or for past Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, the New York Times and Politico reported.
Earlier this week, 27 former Republican lawmakers endorsed Biden while the Lincoln Project, among the most prominent Republican-backed groups opposing Trump, said a former Republican Party head had joined it as a senior adviser.
Thursday's program aimed to counterbalance those defections, featuring a video showcasing former Democratic voters who say they now support Trump and remarks from U.S. Representative Jeff Van Drew, who abandoned the Democratic Party to join the Republicans after voting against Trump's impeachment this year.
""Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,"" he said.
FIREWORKS SPECTACLE
Trump, a former reality television host, and his advisers have set up his speech with a producer's eye. His use of the White House as his backdrop has irked critics who say holding a political event there is a potential violation of the law.
Fireworks were expected over Washington's nearby monuments at the conclusion of Trump's speech.
The Republican convention has attracted fewer television viewers than its Democratic counterpart on two of its three nights so far, including on Wednesday, according to early Nielsen Media Research.
A total of 17.3 million people watched the third night of the mostly virtual Republican National Convention on Wednesday, according to Nielsen, fewer than the 22.8 million viewers for the third night of last week's Democratic convention.
Democrats have criticized Trump's aggressive response to demonstrations sparked by the May 25 Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, a Black man.
On Wednesday, Trump said he was sending federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after violent protests there following the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back.
Trump kicked off the week on Monday by accusing Democrats of seeking to steal the election by advocating for mail-in voting. His previous high-profile speeches have also emphasized grim themes, including his inaugural address in January 2017 that described ""American carnage.""",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-usa-wisconsin-nba-kushner-idUSKBN25N20O,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-election-2020-donald-trump-to-attack-joe-biden-as-us-confronts-coronavirus-anti-racism-protests-5765431.html
4221915,0,1,"Legal hurdles, pandemic would bedevil Biden efforts to undo Trump immigration overhaul",View: The likely Harris impact on Indo-US ties,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he will reverse some of President Donald Trump’s restrictive immigration policies should he win in November, but the dizzying number of changes could take months or years to undo, according to policy and regulatory experts and people close to the Biden campaign. 
They said Biden’s efforts also would be slowed by legal hurdles, political pressure to keep some measures, and a crowded agenda at the beginning of a presidency dominated by the novel coronavirus pandemic. 
“There are going to be a number of urgent matters that require immediate action, including dealing with a global pandemic that has taken hundreds of thousands of lives, including dealing with an economy that is in shambles, all due to President Trump’s failed leadership,” senior Biden campaign adviser Cristóbal Alex said. 
He said Biden was committed to reversing what he called Trump’s “horrific” immigration policies. 
Trump, carrying out a pledge of his “America First” 2016 campaign to reduce legal and illegal immigration, ordered travel bans, hardened efforts to deter Central American migrants entering at the U.S.-Mexico border and made it more difficult for people to obtain refugee status. His administration has blocked immigrants and temporary foreign workers from the United States, saying the moves were needed to preserve jobs for Americans as unemployment soared during coronavirus-related shutdowns. 
Some of the Republican president’s most far-reaching policies have been issued during the pandemic, including blocking many travelers from China, Iran, Europe and Brazil, and suspending non-essential travel across the borders with Canada and Mexico. 
While Biden has criticized some of these restrictions, he has not said if he would immediately reverse them. He has also not commented on emergency border rules implemented in March that allow U.S. authorities to rapidly expel border crossers, including unaccompanied children and asylum seekers. 
Julie Chávez Rodríguez, another senior adviser to the Biden campaign, said he would look to public health officials for guidance on pandemic-related border closures and accused Trump of trying to “scapegoat” immigrants with the restrictions on legal immigration. 
Some of Trump’s executive actions will be relatively easy to undo with the stroke of a pen. But finalized regulations that have gone through a period of public review typically take anywhere from several months to a year to unravel, and could take longer, according to four regulatory experts. Lawsuits could delay attempts to undo Trump regulations and smaller-scale memos and guidance issued to agencies. 
These logistical obstacles mean that Trump’s immigration legacy could endure well beyond his presidency, according to the policy experts, outside Biden campaign advisers and current and former Trump officials. Immigrant advocates who are hoping for faster change would likely be disappointed. 
`BREATHTAKING` 
The architect of Trump’s sweeping immigration agenda, senior adviser Stephen Miller, called the scope of the changes to the U.S. immigration system over the past 3-1/2 years “breathtaking” and “without precedent” - a description echoed by both Trump backers and opponents. 
Miller argued that measures finalized under Trump will not be easy to remove, just as his administration struggled to reverse some policies put in place by previous administrations. 
“In some distant, long-off future time when a Democrat is president, as we all have seen firsthand it is a difficult, complex and time-consuming thing to remove a regulation or a longstanding memorandum,” Miller said in an interview. 
The non-government Migration Policy Institute estimates that the administration has made more than 400 immigration policy changes. A separate tally by advocacy groups puts the figure closer to 1,000. 
The Biden campaign has established an immigration policy working group of volunteers composed of former government officials and immigration advocates. Amy Pope, a former homeland security adviser in the administration of former President Barack Obama, is playing a lead role, according to four people familiar with the effort. 
Several of the people said they were concerned about Pope’s involvement. While Obama did not invoke anti-immigrant rhetoric or attempt to curtail legal immigration, some 3 million immigrants were deported between 2009-2016, earning him the moniker “deporter in chief” from angry activists. Biden served as Obama’s vice president during that period. 
In a 2018 interview, Pope defended Obama’s decision to expand the detention of migrant families arrested at the border. 
The campaign declined to provide Reuters a list of the volunteers. Pope did not respond to a request for comment. 
Biden plans to send an immigration bill to Congress on his first day in office that includes a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally, according to campaign adviser Alex. The bill also would address the status of “Dreamers” who were brought to the United States as children but are now in the country illegally. 
Biden previously pledged to undo Trump’s travel ban on “Day 1” of his presidency, but that would now be slated for his first 100 days in office, according to Alex. The ban blocks a range of travelers from 13 countries, most of which are either majority-Muslim or African nations. 
These bans could be easily undone, as they were issued by executive order and presidential proclamation, the policy experts said, although any changes could be delayed by lawsuits from some conservatives. 
One policy that would be more difficult to undo is Trump’s so-called “public charge” rule, which makes it harder for poorer immigrants - those who receive certain public benefits or are deemed likely to do so - to obtain permanent residence. 
The rule was blocked nationwide by a federal judge in July for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency, but that injunction was later narrowed by an appeals court to apply to just three states. 
To remove the rule, a Biden administration would need to issue another regulation to rescind it unless Congress addressed it in legislation or courts invalidated it, regulatory experts said. 
The fate of Trump’s immigration legacy also would depend on the makeup of Congress after the Nov. 3 elections. If Democrats retain control of the House of Representatives and wrest the Senate from Republicans they will wield more power to push through their agenda. 
But even then it might not be easy. Trump failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature health care reform law, even as his party controlled the House and Senate during the first two years of his presidency. 
Reporting by Ted Hesson in Washington, editing by Ross Colvin and Grant McCool","By Archana Chaudhary and Ganesh NagarajanPlacards lining the road into Kamala Harriss ancestral family village in southern India display her photograph with the caption Singa Pennae, or Lioness.
The phrase from a female power ballad in a popular Tamil movie released last year signaled the excitement in some parts of India over her nomination as the Democratic vice presidential candidate on a ticket with Joe Biden. Her family is confident that Harris, the first Black and Indian-American woman on a major presidential party ticket, will win over the rest of a country that has moved closer to the US thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modis close ties with Donald Trump.
Indians love drama, which explains President Trumps popularity in India, said Harriss maternal uncle, Gopalan Balachandran, an academic based in New Delhi. But I am confident that she will be equally popular.
Forged by theatrics, the Trump-Modi bond culminated in two giant stadium events in front of tens of thousands of their supporters one in Houston last September and the other in Gujarat in February. And while the warming relations have not yet resolved a trade spat, India has expanded arms purchases from the US and aligned with it more openly against China.
The Trump administration has made India a key part of its Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy, and backed Modis government following deadly clashes between Chinese and Indian troops along their disputed Himalayan border in June. India is also a key part of the informal regional grouping to counter China known as the Quad, which also includes the US, Japan and Australia.
Still, the closer ties between the US and India are likely to persist in a Biden-Harris White House, said Amitabh Mattoo, a former member of Indias National Security Council Advisory Board.
They may not roll out a red carpet or give bear hugs or talk about each other in narcissistic terms, but I dont think there will be substantial shift in the importance that Washington has for India that will remain, said Mattoo, the author of more than a dozen books on international relations and a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Biden is unlikely to do anything reckless in terms of changing posture as long as the China threat remains.
A spokesman for the Biden-Harris campaign referred to Bidens plan to place a high priority on continuing to strengthen the US-India relationship. The campaign declined to comment further.
Frayed NervesIndia-US ties have advanced under previous Democratic administrations. In March 2000, President Bill Clinton looked past Indias nuclear tests to begin developing a stronger bilateral relationship. Under the George W. Bush administration, Biden helped pilot the civil nuclear cooperation with India in the Senate as chair of the foreign relations committee.
And though relations soured after the arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York in 2013, Barack Obama mended ties soon after Modis election. The leaders sat for hours together in the rain as Obama become the first US president to be the official chief guest at Indias Republic Day parade.
Trump has hit India on trade while avoiding more controversial issues. While in New Delhi in February, Trump said hed raised the issue of religious freedom with Modi, but declined to comment on demonstrations against the governments new citizenship law discriminating against Muslims. Hes also offered to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir after Modi ended decades of autonomy in Indias only Muslim-majority state.
Harris has expressed more concern about Modis actions, which has led to a lengthy crackdown in Kashmir and nationwide street protests earlier in the year over the citizenship law.
We have to remind Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world, Harris said in September 2019 while on the campaign trail. We are keeping track of the situation. There is a need to intervene if the situation demands. A Biden campaign policy paper outlining his outreach toward Muslim Americans criticized India over Kashmir and the citizenship law, while in a statement released earlier this month he said he would stand by India in confronting the threats it faces along its borders.
Strategic RelationsDespite those issues, BJP said the US and India have deep strategic relations supported widely across party lines in both countries.
As far as the BJP is concerned, we are naturally happy that someone with Indian ancestry is contesting the second topmost post in USA, Vijay Chauthaiwale, chief of foreign affairs in the party who helped organize the Namaste Trump event in Gujarat in February, said in a text message.
Bidens campaign has pledged reform the H-1B visa system and work to eliminate the country-quota for green cards, both issues that are important to the increasingly influential Indian American community. And observers expect him to go easier on trade issues than Trump.
While Harris Indian heritage will no doubt be a positive element in her approach to India, the more important bit is that the administration will not be as publicly harsh on trade and visas, said Arun K Singh, a former Indian ambassador to the US.
Indians form about a fifth of 20 million Asian Americans and are often more educated and earn more than other immigrant groups, the Washington-based Pew Research Center found. About 65% of Indian Americans were Democrats or leaned toward the Democrats, according to a 2014 Pew Research paper.
Politics was a frequent topic of discussion in the Harris family home in India, said Sarala Gopalan, Kamalas aunt, who said the vice presidential candidate is very close to her relatives. Gopalan, one of the Chitthis Harris referred to in her acceptance speech, said the village offered prayers at a local temple when her candidacy was announced.
My father was working for the government, my mother was very much interested in politics, Gopalan, 76, said. She had politics in her blood.

4674718,0,1,"Republican convention praise of Trump economy is risky strategy, poll highlights - Reuters","Joe Biden will be destroyer of American greatness, says Donald Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans’ support for President Donald Trump’s management of the economy has slipped, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows, challenging a bedrock re-election argument laid out at the Republican National Convention this week. 
About 58% of respondents said the U.S. economy is on the wrong track in a survey taken August 19 through 25th. 
And for the first time this year, Trump’s net approval on economic issues dipped into negative territory, with 47% saying they approved of his stewardship of the American economy and 48% saying they disapproved. That is down from an approval margin of 14 percentage points in late March. 
While the poll shows Trump still has an edge with voters over Democratic opponent Joe Biden on the economy, the results highlight the risks the Republican Party is taking by leaning on memories of last year’s strong economy and arguing that Trump will easily be able to restore it. 
“Our economic choice is very clear. Do you want economic health, prosperity, opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation, recession and pessimism?” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said at the convention on Tuesday night. 
“Who do you trust to rebuild this economy?,” Vice President Mike Pence asked Wednesday night. “A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world?” 
BOUNCE AHEAD, BUT THEN WHAT? 
Looking to the fall, just as the U.S. witnessed a historic drop here in gross domestic product from April through June, Trump will be able to trumpet a record increase - equivalent to perhaps 25% on an annualized basis - when statistics are released in October covering the July to September period. 
Neither data point, products of a deliberate shutdown of the economy in March and the automatic impact of reopening from that sudden stop, say much about the economic fortunes of families and businesses during the first months of the pandemic, or in the weeks to come. 
The coronavirus health crisis, with nearly 6 million infected and over 175,000 Americans dead, is still raging. The onset of the conventional flu season is on the horizon, and an experiment underway in reopening schools and colleges is already leading to new spikes in infections. 
Consumer confidence, which can influence future economic activity, remains weak. The national unemployment rate at 10.2% in July is the highest in 39 years, and improvement seems to be slowing. Nearly 15 million Americans are receiving unemployment benefits, the highest on record and double the number hit during the 2007 to 2009 Great Recession. 
The blow has been received hardest among groups including blacks, Hispanics and women who benefited most from last year’s record low unemployment rate. Continued support among white women in particular will be critical to Trump’s electoral chances. 
TRUMP EDGE OVER BIDEN 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll found most voters would not currently back Biden on the economy. 
Trump’s team has been hammering Biden’s discussion of tax policies to pay for rising government debt due to the Trump administration’s earlier tax cuts. 
Among registered voters, Trump still has a five-point edge over Biden in who would be better to manage the economy. 
But the poll also found 30% of Republicans felt the economy was on the wrong track, the highest since February 2018 when Reuters/Ipsos started tracking the question. 
The poll gathered responses from 4,428 American adults, including 1,929 Democrats, 1,750 Republicans and 430 independents. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of between 2-5 percentage points. 
If the economic impact of the pandemic has been in some ways less severe than feared, with household spending returning to pre-pandemic levels and Americans boosting their savings, it is only because of massive government spending and a larger federal footprint in the economy. 
Both Republican and Democratic leaning economists feel much more federal help and a larger federal footprint will be needed to avoid a deeper slide this fall - steps that Trump would have to embrace even as he tries to brand Biden a “socialist.” 
The lapse of $600 a week unemployment benefits, the expiration of loans for small businesses, and the lack of help for state and local governments may in short order pull the rug from economic data that has been more positive than expected since a wave of business lockdowns and social distancing measures in April. 
A Census survey in July said reported “food insecurity” rose more than 20% early in the pandemic, reaching nearly 30 million. 
As former Fed chair Janet Yellen and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities senior adviser Jared Bernstein said in a New York Times column, a lot more people are hungry. 
Both have been briefing Biden on economic issues, and wrote that without further federal spending, “millions of needy Americans will suffer and the overall economy could degrade from its current slow rebound in growth to no growth at all.” 
Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Heather Timmons and Alistair Bell","Seeking another four years in the White House, US President Donald Trump has slammed Democratic rival Joe Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness.
Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration.
Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: Joe Biden is not the saviour of America's soul.""
He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness.""
Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history, Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election.
Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs, Trump alleged.
During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered.
This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas, he said.
This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades, he said.
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens.
And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it, he said.
Referring to the last week's Democrat National Convention, Trump said that Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice.
So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country? he asked.
In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history, he said.
Trump alleged that for 47 years, Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands.
Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, he alleged.
Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defence, he said.
Trump alleged that as vice president Biden supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry.
He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing (Qasem) Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as ""a positive development"" for America and the world. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win, he said.
China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused, Trump said.
He called Biden a Trojan horse for socialism.
Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden's America, he said, referring to violent protests there.
On November 3, he urged his countrymen to send the Democrats led by Biden a thundering message they will never forget! Joe Biden is weak"".
""He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.

She also added, ""Centre is busy issuing sermons, it should instead listen to 'Mann Ki Baat' of students.""
Earlier in the day, ministers of six opposition-ruled states moved the Supreme Court seeking review of its order permitting the Centre to conduct NEET and JEE entrance exams this year.
While the NEET is slated to be held on September 13, engineering entrance exam JEE-Main is scheduled between September 1-6.
Here are the major updates on the NEET, JEE 2020 debate:
1) Congress president Sonia Gandhi said that if the government takes any decision regarding the future of students, it should take it with their concurrence. In a video message which the Congress party tweeted, Sonia Gandhi said, ""My dear students I feel for you because you are now facing a very difficult situation. The issue of your exams of when they should be taken up and where is the most important for you and also your family.""

3) Maharashtra Congress chief and state minister Balasaheb Thorat on Friday slammed the Union government for its insistence on holding JEE and NEET exams amid rising coronavirus cases. This insistence ""when the COVID-19 positive cases has crossed 33 lakh was anti-student and anti-people"", he said.
4) Congress leader Sachin Pilot also held a protest in Rajasthan against the Centre's decision to conduct these examinations and demanded the Centre to postpone the examinations in view of coronavirus pandemic.
5) Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren also echoed the same concerns of several political leaders. He said,""They (Centre) said that lakhs of students have downloaded admit cards. I don't understand what kind of argument is this. If this is the case, then if someone has life insurance, does it mean they'll die soon.""
6) Ministers of six opposition-ruled states moved the Supreme Court against its order allowing holding of these exams physically, saying it failed to secure students' ""right to life"" and ignored ""teething logistical difficulties"" to be faced in conducting them during the COVID-19 pandemic.
7) The review plea has been filed by ministers from West Bengal (Moloy Ghatak), Jharkhand (Rameshwar Oraon), Rajasthan (Raghu Sharma), Chhattisgarh (Amarjeet Bhagat), Punjab (B S Sidhu) and Maharashtra (Uday Ravindra Sawant).

Topics","Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren urged Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank to consider postponing NEET and JEE examinations in view of the coronavirus pandemic.
In a letter to Pokhriyal, the chief minister said there is a risk of spread of infection and with public transport not operating in the state, many candidates would face difficulties in reaching examination centres.
This comes a day after seven chief ministers of non-BJP ruled states, including Soren, decided to file a review petition urging the Supreme Court to reconsider its recent order rejecting the postponement of the two competitive exams.
The decision was taken during a meeting convened by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on a range of issues ahead of Monsoon Session of Parliament.
Both these competitive examinations are extremely critical in the career of a student and their result would decide the course of one's future life, Soren said in his letter, a copy of which he shared on Twitter.
""Every examinee would thus try to put his best foot forward and, therefore, it is extremely essential to ensure that he takes these examinations in an environment of health safety and mental peace,"" he said.
""Currently the people of our country are engaged in combating once in a century disaster of COVID-19 which has affected millions and left thousands dead. Due to health scare as well the economic disruption, there is a widespread prevalence of psychological stress among the people,"" he added.
Soren said conducting examinations of such a large scale would require public transport and hospitality units to function smoothly and optimally.
""As part of its strategy to combat COVID-19, Government of Jharkhand has not yet commenced public transport and neither has it permitted opening of hotels, restaurants etc. Thus the examinees and their guardians are likely to face serious logistic issues,"" he said.
It would be difficult for students whose residence falls in a containment zone to appear in the examinations. It would also be difficult for students who may have a COVID-19 patient at home or maybe suffering from the disease themselves, he added.
""Since there is no way to detect and prevent an infected examinee from appearing in the examination, it would therefore put the rest of the examinees and invigilators in a particular examination hall at the risk of being infected as well,"" Soren said.
""Since comorbidity amongst examinees cannot be ruled out, acquiring of infection by morbid examinees may be life threatening,"" he said.
""In view of the above, I would earnestly request you to kindly consider postponing these two examinations in the public interest,"" he said.
Medical entrance exam NEET is to be held on September 13 and engineering entrance exam JEE Main is scheduled from September 1-6.
While a total of 15.97 lakh students have registered for NEET, 9.53 lakh candidates have registered for JEE-Mains.",https://www.livemint.com/education/news/neet-jee-2020-debate-centre-risking-lives-of-students-by-holding-sept-exams-says-mamata-10-updates-11598617824120.html,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/jharkhand-cm-hemant-soren-writes-to-ramesh-pokhriyal-seeks-postponement-of-neet-jee-exams-5765621.html
6448573,0,1,Will make America worlds manufacturing superpower tax credits to bring back jobs from China: Donald Trump,"Republicans rally behind Trump, say Biden no longer has any principles","Vowing to make America the manufacturing superpower of the world, US President Donald Trump has said that he would provide tax credits to companies that would bring back jobs from China.
Trump, in his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention which re-nominated him as the Republican Party's presidential candidate, said that his administration in the second term will create 10 million jobs in 10 months.
Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will expand opportunity zones, bring home our medical supply chains, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all, Trump said on Thursday night.
He promised to continue reducing taxes and regulations at levels not seen before.
Just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hardworking moms and dads, not raise them. We will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China back to America and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas.
We'll make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country, as I've already been doing. Joe Biden's agenda is Made in China. My agenda is Made in the USA, Trump said as he unveiled his economic vision for his second term.
Trump, 74, who is seeking his re-election in the November presidential elections, is being challenged by Democratic nominee and former vice president Joe Biden.
Biden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale and natural gas laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado and New Mexico. Millions of jobs will be lost and energy prices will soar, he said.
These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week. How can Joe Biden claim to be an ally of the light' when his own party can't even keep the lights on?
For America, nothing is impossible. Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights. And we will show the world that for America, no dream is beyond our reach, Trump said.
The president said that this election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny.
It will decide whether the US will rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether crush industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades, Trump said.
Your vote will decide whether we protect the law abiding Americans, or whether we give free reign to violent anarchists, agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens, he said.
Trump said that he was voted to power four years ago, Washington insiders asked him not to stand up to China.
They pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American people. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest and hardest hitting action against China in American history.
They said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) but again, they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. Now auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees and deserting us, said the president.
Trump said that in the next four years, his administration will have strong borders, strike down terrorists who threaten people, and keep America out of endless and costly foreign wars.
We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, colour and creed. We will uphold your religious liberty, and defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, he said.
The US, under him, will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain number one in the world, and keep America energy independent, he added.
The US and China in the beginning of this year signed Phase-1 of a trade deal, ending a bitter two-year tariff war that had rattled the global economy. Trump has often accused China of stealing American jobs.
Relations between the US and China have plummeted during Trump's time in office, with a trade war, tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats, and angry denunciations coming from both Washington and Beijing.","Top Republican party leaders Thursday night rallied behind President Donald Trump as they used the platform of Republican National Convention to launch a blistering attack on his Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden.
""The Democrats are urging you to vote for an obviously defective candidate. Biden has changed his principles so often, he no longer has any principles, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said in his address to the Republican National Convention before Trump delivered his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House.
""He's a Trojan Horse with Bernie (Sanders), AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), (Nancy) Pelosi, Black Lives Matter and his party's entire Left Wing hidden inside his body just waiting to execute their pro-criminal, anti-police policies, said the former New York City Mayor.
The whole unprecedented wave of lawlessness began with a truly just cause -- the unforgiveable police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Peaceful protests began all over the land. The condemnation of the killing was universal from President Trump to Democrat leaders, he said.
It seemed for a a few brief shining moments' like Democrat and Republican leaders would come together with a unified proposal to reduce police misconduct. This possibility was very dangerous to the Left, Giuliani said.
Biden and his fellow Democrats were widely criticized for not speaking up about the out-of-control violence plaguing Democrat cities in our country. Their silence was so deafening that it reveals an acceptance of this violence because they will accept anything they hope will defeat President Donald Trump, he said.
However, they are making this election a choice between the Democrat policies soft on crime against the Republican program of law and order. It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city, town or suburb, Giuliani said.
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said Joe Biden and Kamala Harris think this election is about the government. They're wrong. It's about you, not us. Your family and your future, he said.
Congressman Jeff Van Drew said that Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running the Democratic Party. the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president, he said.
Debbie Flood, the owner of a Wisconsin machine shop, alleged that Biden voted to normalize trade with China and helped pave the way for them to join the WTO, even though they were hurting American companies like hers.
Our President understands that the best solutions unleash the innovation of American entrepreneurs and the creativity of American workers. Joe Biden doesn't know anything about business. Or about creating jobs, she said.
He's spent 47 years in government. It is doubtful that he'll finally figure it out in year 48. He's pledged to raise our taxes and bring back excessive regulation, Flood said.
US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson said that Trump is the most pro-life President in our country's history. He will continue to fight for those who cannot yet speak, he said.
Our President, Donald J. Trump, believes in the people. He is one of us. He makes promises, and he keeps them. He is transparent, and we certainly know what he's thinking. He does not submit to political correctness or to its enforcers, the media. He is real, Carson said.
Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch said, ""You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America. You can have four more years of President Trump.""
Joe Biden won't stand up for America. Donald Trump will. So this November, let's stand with the president and vote to keep America great, Giuliani said.

799659,0,1,"Ministers from 6 Oppn states move SC, seek review of court’s nod for NEET, JEE exams","6 oppn-ruled states file review petition in SC against order to hold NEET, JEE exams - Hindustan Times","TMCs student wing members hold a protest in Kolkata on Friday against timing of JEE and NEET exams. (Express photo by Partha Paul)Six ministers from Maharashtra, Punjab, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh moved the Supreme Court on Friday and sought review of its August 17 order allowing conduct of NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) entrance examinations.
The plea referred to the rise in Covid-19 cases in the country and said that if the August 17 order is not reviewed, grave and irreparable harm and injury would befall on the student community. The petitioners said not only will health, welfare and safety of students/candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE examinations stand imperilled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy…
The petitioners are Moloy Ghatak (minister from West Bengal), Rameshwar Oraon (Jharkhand), Raghu Sharma (Rajasthan), Amarjeet Bhagat (Chhattisgarh), Balbir Singh Sidhu (Punjab), and Uday Ravindra Samant (Maharashtra).
The petition, filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes, stated that the National Testing Agency (NTA) had notified that NEET (UG) will be held on September 13 and JEE (Mains) from September 1-6.
The plea said that as per NTA, approximately 9.53 lakh and 15.97 lakh students have registered for JEE (Mains) and NEET (UG), respectively. This means 25 lakh students cumulatively would be appearing for these two examinations, the petition stated. As on 27th August, India has over 3.31 million [more than 33 lakh] Covid-19 cases. We are presently at the third position in this unenviable list after the US (5.79 million cases) and Brazil (3.72 million) and on course to be the No. 1 nation on this list.
While there are 660 examination centres for JEE roughly 1,443 students per centre there are 3,843 centres for NEET, or approximately 415 students per centre, the petitioners pointed out. Such large movement of people will ipso facto prove to be a serious health hazard and will totally defeat the twin present-day solutions we have of combating the Covid-19 i.e. social distancing and avoidance of large public gatherings, they said, urging the court to postpone the entrance examinations.

The plea said, Having at least one centre per district would have minimised the inter-district travel of students and thereby reduced chances of Covid-19 spread.
The petitioners said, The mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or willingness or desire to attend physical exams, as no student would like to forego the exam, if its conducted and the respondents are forcing the students to put their lives and health in peril by conducting these exams.
In a situation, the plea said, where there is absolutely no classroom teaching, the decision of the Union Government to conduct examinations on such a massive scale reveals non-application of mind and is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious exercise of power.
The petitioners said they do not wish to make any value judgment or political criticism of the Union Government in such times but the undisputed facts are that there has been an exponential increase in both Covid-19 positive cases as well as deaths/mortality arising out of Covid-19 from April, when these exams were originally scheduled, till August, when the Union Government decided to conduct the said examinations.
The Covid-19 graph is showing a continuous upward movement and the ‘curve’ has not flattened for the Government to undertake such a massive exercise, the petition stated. It said that schools and colleges continue to remain shut despite the various phases of unlock and there is no rational nexus between the object of the examinations and the purpose that it seeks to achieve.

The six ministers stated that the Centre had adequate time to make comprehensive preparations for safe and successful conduct of the examinations. However, they argued, the intervening months from April to September were characterised by inaction, confusion, lethargy and inertia…now the Union Government has suddenly woken up to realise that their inertia is going to cost lakhs of students their academic year and therefore as a knee-jerk reaction…has haphazardly and hurriedly fixed the dates of the examinations.
The petitioners called it a remedy that will prove to be worse than the disease itself.
The plea said that postponing the exams by two months would give valuable time to the government to put in place an adequate mechanism in consultation with the State Governments, to ensure a smoother and safer conduct of examinations.
The petition also pointed to health issues of students and said that even otherwise, with recent evidences and information of the virus being allegedly airborne now, conducting of physical examination of such magnitude can have disastrous consequences.

The petition said there have been instances where surge in cases have been reported after offline exams were conducted.
The process of reaching the examination centre itself can be a major source of contracting the infection, and candidates may become vectors carrying the virus to their homes, it said.
The petitioners said, The mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or willingness or desire to attend physical exams, as no student would like to forego the exam, if its conducted and the respondents are forcing the students to put their lives and health in peril by conducting these exams.
They said, If the Union Govt/NTA decides to hold the exams, then the students do not have an effective choice left but to register and appear for the exam at great personal risk.
Oppn parties slam Centre: Listen to students
After approaching the Supreme Court, four Opposition parties led by the Congress on Friday hit out at the BJP-led central government, accusing it of being stubborn about holding the NEET and JEE examinations.
Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the government has been incompetent. He and Congress president Sonia Gandhi asked the government to listen to students.
Please, listen to them. Have a conversation and resolve this issue peacefully, he said.
Addressing a joint press conference, Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren (JMM), Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O Brien and Maharashtra Higher Education Minister Uday Samant (Shiv Sena) slammed the Centre over the issue.

Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration.
Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: Joe Biden is not the saviour of America's soul.""
He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness.""
Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history, Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election.
Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs, Trump alleged.
During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered.
This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas, he said.
This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades, he said.
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens.
And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it, he said.
Referring to the last week's Democrat National Convention, Trump said that Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice.
So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country? he asked.
In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history, he said.
Trump alleged that for 47 years, Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands.
Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, he alleged.
Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defence, he said.
Trump alleged that as vice president Biden supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry.
He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing (Qasem) Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as ""a positive development"" for America and the world. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win, he said.
China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused, Trump said.
He called Biden a Trojan horse for socialism.
Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden's America, he said, referring to violent protests there.
On November 3, he urged his countrymen to send the Democrats led by Biden a thundering message they will never forget! Joe Biden is weak"".
""He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.","US President Donald Trump has officially accepted the re-nomination of the Republican Party as its presidential candidate for the November elections, telling his fellow Americans that at no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas.
Trump, 74, in his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House amidst cheers from his supporters on Thursday night, said: My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States.
I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years, Trump said.
In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity! he said.
Party's delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
Pence delivered his acceptance speech from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday. This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Addressing an audience of about 1,500 invited guests, Trump said that the Republican Party goes forward united, determined and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
Trump and Pence are being challenged by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin senator Kamala Harris.
Harris, 55, has scripted history by becoming the first African-American and Indian-origin person to be nominated as a vice presidential candidate by a major political party.
As per an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days from now is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump's acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party, which gathers once in four years in one of the American cities to nominate its presidential candidate.
This year it was scheduled to be held in Charlotte in North Carolina. Due to the restrictions on social gatherings as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the convention went into a virtual mode, with only essential official business being held in Charlotte.
Popular Indian-American politician Nikki Haley was the star speaker on Monday, the first day. First Lady Melania Trump addressed the convention from Rose Garden of the White House on Tuesday, while Pence delivered his acceptance speech on Wednesday.
Trump's daughter Ivanka, who is also his presidential advisor, addressed the convention before him on Thursday night.
He's our commander-in-chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. He is our president, and my father, Donald J Trump, Ivanka said.
His son Donald Trump Jr addressed the convention on Monday, while daughter Tiffney and other son Eric addressed the convention on Tuesday and daughter-in-law Lara on Wednesday. A group of protesters had gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House in advance of Trump's speech.
Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, and his wife were among the special invitees on the South Lawns of the White House for Trump's acceptance speech. Al Mason said it was amazing spectacular and full of enthusiasm never seen in the Democratic convention last week.

Biden said Thursday there's no question the debates will take place, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters earlier in the day that she didn't think Biden should debate the president at all. Pelosi said she knows she disagrees with Biden on this, but she doesn't think he should legitimize a conversation with Trump.
The Democratic nominee has repeatedly said he is eager to take on the president.
Here's the deal with bullies, I understand how they work, Biden said on CNN.
And I'm going to play by the rules of the debate commission and we're going to have a debate.
In a separate interview on MSNBC, Biden said he's going to be a fact checker on the floor during the debates and he thinks the media will fact check Trump as well.
Pelosi said she believes Trump will probably act in a way that is beneath the dignity of the presidency and belittle what the debates are supposed to be about.
She said a 2016 debate between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton was disgraceful as Trump stood close behind Clinton as she spoke, moving into her camera angle. Pelosi says Trump was stalking Clinton and should have been told to move away.
Instead, Pelosi suggests the two candidates have individual events where they take questions.
Let that be a conversation with the American people, she said. Not an exercise in skullduggery. The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates recently rejected a request from the Trump campaign either to add a fourth debate or move up the three already scheduled. Trump's campaign said 16 states will have started voting by the time of the first debate on Sept. 29.
Trump is set to accept the Republican presidential nomination Thursday night.

7237639,0,1,Joe Biden's victory will endanger nation and destroy American greatness: Donald Trump,"Theatrics aside, Kamala Harris may help build on Trump's India policy","Washington: Seeking another four years in the White House, US President Donald Trump has slammed Democratic rival Joe Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness. 
Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration. 
Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: ""Joe Biden is not the saviour of America's soul."" 
""He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness."" 
""Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history,"" Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate. 
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election. 
""Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs,"" Trump alleged. 
During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). 
Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered. 
""This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" he said. 
""This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades,"" he said. 
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens. 
""And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it,"" he said. 
Referring to the last week's Democrat National Convention, Trump said that Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. 
""So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?"" he asked. 
""In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history,"" he said. 
Trump alleged that for 47 years, Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain - and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands. 
""Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars,"" he alleged. 
""Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defence,"" he said. 
Trump alleged that as vice president Biden supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. 
""He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants.

""He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.","Placards lining the road into Kamala Harris’s ancestral family village in southern India display her photograph with the caption “Singa Pennae,” or “Lioness.”
The phrase from a female power ballad in a popular Tamil-language movie released last year signaled the excitement in some parts of India over her nomination as the Democratic vice presidential candidate on a ticket with Joe Biden. Her family is confident that Harris, the first Black and Indian-American woman on a major presidential party ticket, will win over the rest of a country that has moved closer to the U.S. thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s close ties with Donald Trump.
“Indians love drama, which explains President Trump’s popularity in India,” said Harris’s maternal uncle, Gopalan Balachandran, an academic based in New Delhi. “But I am confident that she will be equally popular.”
Forged by theatrics, the Trump-Modi bond culminated in two giant stadium events in front of tens of thousands of their supporters -- one in Houston last September and the other in Modi’s home state of Gujarat in February. And while the warming relations have not yet resolved a trade spat, India has expanded arms purchases from the U.S. and aligned with it more openly against China.
The Trump administration has made India a key part of its “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” strategy, and backed Modi’s government following deadly clashes between Chinese and Indian troops along their disputed Himalayan border in June. India is also a key part of the informal regional grouping to counter China known as the Quad, which also includes the U.S., Japan and Australia.

Still, the closer ties between the U.S. and India are likely to persist in a Biden-Harris White House, said Amitabh Mattoo, a former member of India’s National Security Council Advisory Board.
“They may not roll out a red carpet or give bear hugs or talk about each other in narcissistic terms, but I don’t think there will be substantial shift in the importance that Washington has for India -- that will remain,” said Mattoo, the author of more than a dozen books on international relations and a professor at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University. Biden is “unlikely to do anything reckless in terms of changing posture as long as the China threat remains.”
A spokesman for the Biden-Harris campaign referred to Biden’s plan to place “a high priority on continuing to strengthen the U.S.-India relationship.” The campaign declined to comment further.
Frayed Nerves
India-U.S. ties have advanced under previous Democratic administrations. In March 2000, President Bill Clinton looked past India’s nuclear tests to begin developing a stronger bilateral relationship. Under the George W. Bush administration, Biden helped pilot the civil nuclear cooperation with India in the Senate as chair of the foreign relations committee.
And though relations soured after the arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York in 2013, Barack Obama mended ties soon after Modi’s election. The leaders sat for hours together in the rain as Obama become the first U.S. president to be the official “chief guest” at India’s Republic Day parade.

Trump has hit India on trade while avoiding more controversial issues. While in New Delhi in February, Trump said he’d raised the issue of religious freedom with Modi, but declined to comment on demonstrations against the government’s new citizenship law discriminating against Muslims. He’s also offered to “mediate” between India and its rival Pakistan on Kashmir after Modi ended decades of autonomy in India’s only Muslim-majority state.
Harris has expressed more concern about Modi’s actions, which has led to a lengthy crackdown in Kashmir and nationwide street protests earlier in the year over the citizenship law.
“We have to remind Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world,” Harris said in September 2019 while on the campaign trail. “We are keeping track of the situation. There is a need to intervene if the situation demands.” A Biden campaign policy paper outlining his outreach toward Muslim Americans criticized India over Kashmir and the citizenship law, while in a statement released earlier this month he said he would stand by India in confronting the threats it faces along its borders.
‘Strategic Relations’
Despite those issues, Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party said the U.S. and India have “deep strategic relations” supported widely across party lines in both countries.
“As far as the BJP is concerned, we are naturally happy that someone with Indian ancestry is contesting the second topmost post in USA,” Vijay Chauthaiwale, chief of foreign affairs in the party who helped organize the ‘Namaste Trump’ event in Gujarat in February, said in a text message.
Biden’s campaign has pledged reform the H-1B visa system and work to eliminate the country-quota for green cards, both issues that are important to the increasingly influential Indian American community. And observers expect him to go easier on trade issues than Trump.
“While Harris’ Indian heritage will no doubt be a positive element in her approach to India, the more important bit is that the administration will not be as publicly harsh on trade and visas,” said Arun K Singh, a former Indian ambassador to the U.S.
Indians form about a fifth of 20 million Asian Americans and are often more educated and earn more than other immigrant groups, the Washington-based Pew Research Center found. About 65% of Indian Americans were Democrats or leaned toward the Democrats, according to a 2014 Pew Research paper.
Politics was a frequent topic of discussion in the Harris family home in India, said Sarala Gopalan, Kamala’s aunt, who said the vice presidential candidate is very close to her relatives. Gopalan, one of the ‘Chitthis’ Harris referred to in her acceptance speech, said the village offered prayers at a local temple when her candidacy was announced.
“My father was working for the government, my mother was very much interested in politics,” Gopalan, 76, said. She had politics “in her blood.”

4674755,0,1,"Republican convention praise of Trump economy is risky strategy, poll highlights - Reuters","US Election 2020: Joe Biden will be destroyer of American greatness, says Donald Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans’ support for President Donald Trump’s management of the economy has slipped, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows, challenging a bedrock re-election argument laid out at the Republican National Convention this week. 
About 58% of respondents said the U.S. economy is on the wrong track in a survey taken August 19 through 25th. 
And for the first time this year, Trump’s net approval on economic issues dipped into negative territory, with 47% saying they approved of his stewardship of the American economy and 48% saying they disapproved. That is down from an approval margin of 14 percentage points in late March. 
While the poll shows Trump still has an edge with voters over Democratic opponent Joe Biden on the economy, the results highlight the risks the Republican Party is taking by leaning on memories of last year’s strong economy and arguing that Trump will easily be able to restore it. 
“Our economic choice is very clear. Do you want economic health, prosperity, opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation, recession and pessimism?” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said at the convention on Tuesday night. 
“Who do you trust to rebuild this economy?,” Vice President Mike Pence asked Wednesday night. “A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world?” 
BOUNCE AHEAD, BUT THEN WHAT? 
Looking to the fall, just as the U.S. witnessed a historic drop here in gross domestic product from April through June, Trump will be able to trumpet a record increase - equivalent to perhaps 25% on an annualized basis - when statistics are released in October covering the July to September period. 
Neither data point, products of a deliberate shutdown of the economy in March and the automatic impact of reopening from that sudden stop, say much about the economic fortunes of families and businesses during the first months of the pandemic, or in the weeks to come. 
The coronavirus health crisis, with nearly 6 million infected and over 175,000 Americans dead, is still raging. The onset of the conventional flu season is on the horizon, and an experiment underway in reopening schools and colleges is already leading to new spikes in infections. 
Consumer confidence, which can influence future economic activity, remains weak. The national unemployment rate at 10.2% in July is the highest in 39 years, and improvement seems to be slowing. Nearly 15 million Americans are receiving unemployment benefits, the highest on record and double the number hit during the 2007 to 2009 Great Recession. 
The blow has been received hardest among groups including blacks, Hispanics and women who benefited most from last year’s record low unemployment rate. Continued support among white women in particular will be critical to Trump’s electoral chances. 
TRUMP EDGE OVER BIDEN 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll found most voters would not currently back Biden on the economy. 
Trump’s team has been hammering Biden’s discussion of tax policies to pay for rising government debt due to the Trump administration’s earlier tax cuts. 
Among registered voters, Trump still has a five-point edge over Biden in who would be better to manage the economy. 
But the poll also found 30% of Republicans felt the economy was on the wrong track, the highest since February 2018 when Reuters/Ipsos started tracking the question. 
The poll gathered responses from 4,428 American adults, including 1,929 Democrats, 1,750 Republicans and 430 independents. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of between 2-5 percentage points. 
If the economic impact of the pandemic has been in some ways less severe than feared, with household spending returning to pre-pandemic levels and Americans boosting their savings, it is only because of massive government spending and a larger federal footprint in the economy. 
Both Republican and Democratic leaning economists feel much more federal help and a larger federal footprint will be needed to avoid a deeper slide this fall - steps that Trump would have to embrace even as he tries to brand Biden a “socialist.” 
The lapse of $600 a week unemployment benefits, the expiration of loans for small businesses, and the lack of help for state and local governments may in short order pull the rug from economic data that has been more positive than expected since a wave of business lockdowns and social distancing measures in April. 
A Census survey in July said reported “food insecurity” rose more than 20% early in the pandemic, reaching nearly 30 million. 
As former Fed chair Janet Yellen and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities senior adviser Jared Bernstein said in a New York Times column, a lot more people are hungry. 
Both have been briefing Biden on economic issues, and wrote that without further federal spending, “millions of needy Americans will suffer and the overall economy could degrade from its current slow rebound in growth to no growth at all.”

7719692,0,1,"Republicans rally behind Trump, say Biden no longer has any principles","Trump, Republicans attack Biden amid coronavirus crisis, street protests","Top Republican party leaders Thursday night rallied behind President Donald Trump as they used the platform of Republican National Convention to launch a blistering attack on his Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden.
""The Democrats are urging you to vote for an obviously defective candidate. Biden has changed his principles so often, he no longer has any principles, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said in his address to the Republican National Convention before Trump delivered his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House.
""He's a Trojan Horse with Bernie (Sanders), AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), (Nancy) Pelosi, Black Lives Matter and his party's entire Left Wing hidden inside his body just waiting to execute their pro-criminal, anti-police policies, said the former New York City Mayor.
The whole unprecedented wave of lawlessness began with a truly just cause -- the unforgiveable police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Peaceful protests began all over the land. The condemnation of the killing was universal from President Trump to Democrat leaders, he said.
It seemed for a a few brief shining moments' like Democrat and Republican leaders would come together with a unified proposal to reduce police misconduct. This possibility was very dangerous to the Left, Giuliani said.
Biden and his fellow Democrats were widely criticized for not speaking up about the out-of-control violence plaguing Democrat cities in our country. Their silence was so deafening that it reveals an acceptance of this violence because they will accept anything they hope will defeat President Donald Trump, he said.
However, they are making this election a choice between the Democrat policies soft on crime against the Republican program of law and order. It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city, town or suburb, Giuliani said.
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said Joe Biden and Kamala Harris think this election is about the government. They're wrong. It's about you, not us. Your family and your future, he said.
Congressman Jeff Van Drew said that Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running the Democratic Party. the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president, he said.
Debbie Flood, the owner of a Wisconsin machine shop, alleged that Biden voted to normalize trade with China and helped pave the way for them to join the WTO, even though they were hurting American companies like hers.
Our President understands that the best solutions unleash the innovation of American entrepreneurs and the creativity of American workers. Joe Biden doesn't know anything about business. Or about creating jobs, she said.
He's spent 47 years in government. It is doubtful that he'll finally figure it out in year 48. He's pledged to raise our taxes and bring back excessive regulation, Flood said.
US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson said that Trump is the most pro-life President in our country's history. He will continue to fight for those who cannot yet speak, he said.
Our President, Donald J. Trump, believes in the people. He is one of us. He makes promises, and he keeps them. He is transparent, and we certainly know what he's thinking. He does not submit to political correctness or to its enforcers, the media. He is real, Carson said.
Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch said, ""You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America. You can have four more years of President Trump.""
Joe Biden won't stand up for America. Donald Trump will. So this November, let's stand with the president and vote to keep America great, Giuliani said.
(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, accepting the Republican nomination for a second term, said on Thursday that he alone stands as a bulwark against the forces of socialism, anarchy and extremism that his Democratic rival Joe Biden would champion if elected in November. 
Speaking from the White House South Lawn despite criticism he was using the executive residence as a political prop, Trump asserted that a Biden victory would only worsen the crises besieging the country. 
“This election will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny.” Trump said on the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention. “This election will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans, or whether we give free rein to violent anarchic agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens.” 
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, Trump delivered his remarks in front of more than 1,000 people, standing in front of dozens of American flags and basking in chants of “Four more years!” and “U.S.A.!” 
Though an incumbent seeking a second four-year term, Trump remains a self-styled outsider, an approach that won him the White House, his first elected office, in 2016 on a promise to end the crime and violence he said was afflicting the country. 
On Thursday, he and other Republican speakers argued that state and city Democratic leaders, not the Trump administration, were to blame for the racial strife convulsing U.S. cities, including Kenosha, Wisconsin, where this week police shot and paralysed a Black man. 
“No one will be safe in Biden’s America,” Trump said despite the surge of unrest during his watch. 
As the night unfolded, Biden struck back on Twitter, writing, “When Donald Trump says tonight you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump’s America?” 
The made-for-television scene - befitting the first reality TV host to serve as president - stood in marked contrast to Biden’s acceptance speech last week, which was broadcast live from a largely empty arena in a nod to the disease. 
The crowd, seated in white chairs inches apart, showed little evidence of social distancing or face masks despite health experts’ recommendations. 
The coronavirus prompted both political parties to scale back their conventions and make events mostly virtual. The Trump campaign said it had taken appropriate health precautions. 
In a reminder of the country’s divisions, attendees could hear anti-Trump protesters at nearby Black Lives Matter Plaza as he spoke. 
MORE THAN 180,000 DEATHS 
More than 180,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus - more than any other country, according to a Reuters tally - amid a fresh wave of protests over the latest high-profile police shooting of a Black American. 
In Kenosha, relative calm returned after three nights of civil strife ending on Tuesday, including arson, vandalism and deadly shootings. 
Trump, a former New York real estate developer, is seeking to turn around a re-election campaign that has been largely overshadowed by a health crisis that has put millions of Americans out of work. 
In his speech on Thursday, Trump repeated his assertion that China is to blame for the pandemic and promised to rebuild what Republicans have called the “greatest economy” in history. But opinion polls have shown most Americans are disappointed in his response to the coronavirus, which he played down for weeks. 
While his approval rating among Republican voters remains high, dissent is mounting within the party. In three open letters being published on Thursday and Friday, Biden won endorsements from more than 160 people who worked for Republican former President George W. Bush or for past Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, the New York Times and Politico reported. 
Earlier this week, 27 former Republican lawmakers endorsed Biden while the Lincoln Project, among the most prominent Republican-backed groups opposing Trump, said a former Republican Party head had joined it as a senior adviser. 
Thursday’s program aimed to counterbalance those defections, featuring a video showcasing former Democratic voters who say they now support Trump and remarks from U.S. Representative Jeff Van Drew, who abandoned the Democratic Party to join the Republicans after voting against Trump’s impeachment this year. 
“Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,” he said. 
The program also included several emotional appeals, including from the parents of Kayla Mueller, an aid worker who died after being held captive for months by Islamic State militants in Syria. The Mueller parents said they blamed the Obama administration for failing to rescue Mueller. 
The Republican convention has attracted fewer television viewers than its Democratic counterpart on two of its three nights so far, including on Wednesday, according to early Nielsen Media Research. 
A total of 17.3 million people watched the third night of the mostly virtual Republican National Convention on Wednesday, according to Nielsen, fewer than the 22.8 million viewers for the third night of last week’s Democratic convention. 
Trump kicked off the week on Monday by accusing Democrats of seeking to steal the election by advocating for mail-in voting. His previous high-profile speeches have also emphasized grim themes, including his inaugural address in January 2017 that described “American carnage.”

Every morning, one of the first browser tabs I open is CrowdTangle a handy Facebook-owned data tool that offers a birds-eye view of whats popular on the platform. I check which politicians and pundits are going viral. I geek out on trending topics. I browse the previous days stories to see which got the most reactions, shares and comments.
Most days, the leader board looks roughly the same: conservative post after conservative post, with the occasional liberal interloper. (If you want to see these lists for yourselves, you can check out @FacebooksTop10, a Twitter account I created that shows the top 10 most-interacted-with link posts by U.S. Facebook pages every day.)
Its no secret that, despite Trumps claims of Silicon Valley censorship, Facebook has been a boon to him and his allies, and hyperpartisan Facebook pages are nothing new. (In fact, my colleague John Herrman wrote about them four years ago this month.)
But what sticks out, when you dig in to the data, is just how dominant the Facebook right truly is. Pro-Trump political influencers have spent years building a well-oiled media machine that swarms around every major news story, creating a torrent of viral commentary that reliably drowns out both the mainstream media and the liberal opposition.
The result is a kind of parallel media universe that left-of-center Facebook users may never encounter, but that has been stunningly effective in shaping its own version of reality. Inside the right-wing Facebook bubble, Trumps response to COVID-19 has been strong and effective, Joe Biden is barely capable of forming sentences, and Black Lives Matter is a dangerous group of violent looters.
Trump and his supporters are betting that, despite being behind Biden in the polls, a silent majority will carry him to reelection. Donald Trump Jr., the presidents oldest and most online son, made that argument himself at the Republican National Convention this week. And while Im not a political analyst, I know enough about the modern media landscape to know that looking at peoples revealed preferences what they actually read, watch, and click on when nobodys looking is often a better indicator of how theyll act than interviewing them at diners, or listening to what theyre willing to say out loud to a pollster.
Maybe Trumps silent majority, in other words, only seems silent because were not looking at their Facebook feeds.
We live in two different countries right now, said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist and digital director of Marco Rubios 2016 campaign. Facebooks media ecosystem, he said, is a huge blind spot for people who are up to speed on whats on the front page of The New York Times and whats leading the hour on CNN.
To be sure, Facebook is not the only medium where right-wing content thrives. Millions of Americans still get their news from cable news and talk radio, where conservative voices have dominated for years. Many pro-Trump Facebook influencers also have sizable presences on Twitter, YouTube and other social networks.
But the rights dominance on Facebook, specifically, is something to behold.
Here are just a few data points I pulled from CrowdTangle this week:
The conservative commentator Ben Shapiro has gotten 56 million total interactions on his Facebook page in the last 30 days. Thats more than the main pages of ABC News, NBC News, The New York Times, The Washington Post and NPR combined. (Data from a different firm, NewsWhip, showed that Shapiros news outlet, The Daily Wire, was the No. 1 publisher on Facebook in July.)
Facebook posts by Breitbart, the far-right news outlet, have been shared 4 million times in the past 30 days, roughly three times as many as posts from the official pages of every Democratic member of the U.S. Senate combined.
The most-shared Facebook post containing the term Black Lives Matter over the past six months is a June video by the right-wing commentators The Hodgetwins, which calls the racial justice movement a damn lie. The second most-shared Black Lives Matter post? A different viral video from The Hodgetwins, this one calling the movement a leftist lie. (The Hodgetwins also have the 4th, 6th, and 12th most shared posts.)
Terrence K. Williams, a conservative comedian and Trump supporter, has averaged 86,500 interactions per Facebook post in August, more than twice as many as Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, who has averaged 39,000 interactions per post. (Trump outdoes them both, naturally, with an average of 92,000 interactions per post.)
A few caveats, before my Democratic readers jump off the nearest pier.
These figures include only posts on public pages, in public groups, and by verified accounts, and they dont include Facebook ads, where the Biden campaign has been outspending the Trump campaign in recent weeks. Counting Facebook interactions doesnt tell you how someone felt about a post, so its possible some conservative posts are being hate-shared by liberals. And Facebook has argued that engagement isnt the same thing as popularity.
These points look mostly at how people engage with content, which should not be confused with how many people actually see it on Facebook, Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. Osborne added that when you look at the content that gets the most reach across Facebook, its not at all as partisan as this reporting suggests. (Facebook does not disclose this type of data publicly, except once in a while in response to my tweets.)
Democrats arent totally absent from Facebooks upper echelon. Ridin With Biden, a pro-Biden page started in April by the founders of the liberal Facebook page Occupy Democrats, has quadrupled its following over the past three months, and routinely gets more engagement than Breitbart and other right-wing heavy-hitters. Individual posts by Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama and other prominent Democrats have broken through in recent weeks.
And political campaigners have pointed out, correctly, that being popular on the internet isnt a guarantee of electoral success. (Retweets dont vote, as an experienced Democratic operative once told me.) In addition, Facebooks older, more conservative user base may not reflect whats happening on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, which draw a younger crowd.
Still, the platforms sheer scale makes it vital to understand. As of 2019, 70% of American adults used Facebook, and 43% of Americans got news on the platform, according to the Pew Research Center. (Those numbers may have increased because of the pandemic.) We know that the companys product decisions can make or break political movements, move fringe ideas into the mainstream, or amplify partisan polarization. Registering 4 million voters before the November election, as Facebook has said it would do, could be a decisive force all on its own. (Typically, higher turnout benefits Democrats, but given what we know about the media diets of hyperactive Facebook users, who knows?)
The reason right-wing content performs so well on Facebook is no mystery. The platform is designed to amplify emotionally resonant posts, and conservative commentators are skilled at turning passionate grievances into powerful algorithm fodder. The company also appears willing to bend its rules for popular conservative influencers. A recent report by NBC News, citing a leaked internal report, found that Facebook executives had removed strikes from the accounts of several high-profile conservative pages that had shared viral misinformation in violation of the companys rules.
Over the past few years, Ive come to view my daily Facebook data-dive as a kind of early-warning system a rough gauge of whats grabbing Americas attention on any given day, and which stories and perspectives will likely break through in the days to come.
And looking at Facebooks lopsided political media ecosystem might be a useful reality check for Democrats who think Biden will coast to victory in November.
After all, Trumps surging popularity showed up online before it showed up in any polls in 2016. And even though much about Facebook, and American politics, has changed in the past four years, the basic laws of social media physics still apply. Controversy wins. Negative beats positive. All attention looks good to an algorithm.
Brad Parscale the digital director of Trumps 2016 campaign told 60 Minutes that of everything Trump did that year, the thing that actually moved the needle was Facebook.
Facebook was the method, Parscale said. It was the highway which his car drove on.
That highway is still open. And right now, the fastest cars on it have MAGA bumper stickers.","Placards lining the road into Kamala Harriss ancestral family village in southern India display her photograph with the caption Singa Pennae,"" or Lioness.""The phrase from a female power ballad in a popular Tamil-language movie released last year signaled the excitement in some parts of India over her nomination as the Democratic vice presidential candidate on a ticket with Joe Biden. Her family is confident that Harris, the first Black and Indian-American woman on a major presidential party ticket, will win over the rest of a country that has moved closer to the U.S. thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modis close ties with Donald Trump.
Indians love drama, which explains President Trumps popularity in India,"" said Harriss maternal uncle, Gopalan Balachandran, an academic based in New Delhi. But I am confident that she will be equally popular.""
Forged by theatrics, the Trump-Modi bond culminated in two giant stadium events in front of tens of thousands of their supporters -- one in Houston last September and the other in Modis home state of Gujarat in February. And while the warming relations have not yet resolved a trade spat, India has expanded arms purchases from the U.S. and aligned with it more openly against China.
The Trump administration has made India a key part of its Free and Open Indo-Pacific"" strategy, and backed Modis government following deadly clashes between Chinese and Indian troops along their disputed Himalayan border in June. India is also a key part of the informal regional grouping to counter China known as the Quad, which also includes the U.S., Japan and Australia.
Still, the closer ties between the U.S. and India are likely to persist in a Biden-Harris White House, said Amitabh Mattoo, a former member of Indias National Security Council Advisory Board.
They may not roll out a red carpet or give bear hugs or talk about each other in narcissistic terms, but I dont think there will be substantial shift in the importance that Washington has for India -- that will remain,"" said Mattoo, the author of more than a dozen books on international relations and a professor at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University. Biden is unlikely to do anything reckless in terms of changing posture as long as the China threat remains.""
A spokesman for the Biden-Harris campaign referred to Bidens plan to place a high priority on continuing to strengthen the U.S.-India relationship."" The campaign declined to comment further.
Frayed Nerves
India-U.S. ties have advanced under previous Democratic administrations. In March 2000, President Bill Clinton looked past Indias nuclear tests to begin developing a stronger bilateral relationship. Under the George W. Bush administration, Biden helped pilot the civil nuclear cooperation with India in the Senate as chair of the foreign relations committee.
And though relations soured after the arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York in 2013, Barack Obama mended ties soon after Modis election. The leaders sat for hours together in the rain as Obama become the first U.S. president to be the official chief guest"" at Indias Republic Day parade.
Trump has hit India on trade while avoiding more controversial issues. While in New Delhi in February, Trump said hed raised the issue of religious freedom with Modi, but declined to comment on demonstrations against the governments new citizenship law discriminating against Muslims. Hes also offered to mediate"" between India and its rival Pakistan on Kashmir after Modi ended decades of autonomy in Indias only Muslim-majority state.
Harris has expressed more concern about Modis actions, which has led to a lengthy crackdown in Kashmir and nationwide street protests earlier in the year over the citizenship law.
We have to remind Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world,"" Harris said in September 2019 while on the campaign trail. We are keeping track of the situation. There is a need to intervene if the situation demands."" A Biden campaign policy paper outlining his outreach toward Muslim Americans criticized India over Kashmir and the citizenship law, while in a statement released earlier this month he said he would stand by India in confronting the threats it faces along its borders.
Strategic Relations
Despite those issues, Modis ruling Bharatiya Janata Party said the U.S. and India have deep strategic relations"" supported widely across party lines in both countries.
As far as the BJP is concerned, we are naturally happy that someone with Indian ancestry is contesting the second topmost post in USA,"" Vijay Chauthaiwale, chief of foreign affairs in the party who helped organize the Namaste Trump event in Gujarat in February, said in a text message.
Bidens campaign has pledged reform the H-1B visa system and work to eliminate the country-quota for green cards, both issues that are important to the increasingly influential Indian American community. And observers expect him to go easier on trade issues than Trump.
While Harris Indian heritage will no doubt be a positive element in her approach to India, the more important bit is that the administration will not be as publicly harsh on trade and visas,"" said Arun K Singh, a former Indian ambassador to the U.S.
Indians form about a fifth of 20 million Asian Americans and are often more educated and earn more than other immigrant groups, the Washington-based Pew Research Center found. About 65% of Indian Americans were Democrats or leaned toward the Democrats, according to a 2014 Pew Research paper.
Politics was a frequent topic of discussion in the Harris family home in India, said Sarala Gopalan, Kamalas aunt, who said the vice presidential candidate is very close to her relatives. Gopalan, one of the Chitthis Harris referred to in her acceptance speech, said the village offered prayers at a local temple when her candidacy was announced.
My father was working for the government, my mother was very much interested in politics,"" Gopalan, 76, said. She had politics in her blood.""

3710760,0,1,Breakingviews - Cox: Republicans mostly rant about fake socialism - Reuters,US elections: Nancy Pelosi says there shouldn't be any Biden-Trump debates,"ZURICH (Reuters Breakingviews) - Pop into a gas station just about anywhere in south Florida to fill up the tank or snag a hot dog marinating in its own juices, and you may well be giving Maximo Alvarez your business. Having fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba under Operation Peter Pan, which airlifted unaccompanied minors to the United States in the early 1960s, Alvarez founded Sunshine Gasoline Distributors in 1987. He now has 536 Exxon, Shell, Chevron, Mobil and Marathon outlets.  
Alvarez’s story is quintessentially American. That’s no doubt why he was chosen to address the first night of this week’s Republican National Convention, which ended on Thursday. The four days combined earnest testimonials about President Donald Trump’s achievements with venom-spitting vitriol about his opponents, all of it shellacked with the sort of reality-television varnish that launched Trump’s celebrity in the first place.  
When it comes to policies, the GOP was reticent about what another four years of Trump would bring. Speakers preferred to attack Democratic nominee Joe Biden. A vote for him, they said, was a vote for the sort of rack and ruin that, ironically, is on grim display in many U.S. cities today.   
Alvarez brought in one variety of this right at the beginning. Again and again, Biden was painted as a proponent or a dupe for the most evil of ideologies. To quote from Trump’s hour-long speech from the White House lawn on Thursday night, the former vice president is a “Trojan Horse for socialism”.   
The narrative may be compelling, but it is almost entirely fallacious. True, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders styles himself as a democratic socialist. But all that means is that he thinks the government should have a somewhat larger role in the economy than it does now. Most of the tiny group of scruffy true believers in actual Marxist-Leninist ideology think Sanders is just another centrist.   
Those real communists are right. Sanders and his backers call for policies that are considered tepid centre-left in every other developed economy: universal health care, stronger welfare programmes, and more redistributive taxes. Indeed, to most of America’s rich friends, allies and trading partners, the American socialism-versus-capitalism debate looks downright silly.  
Alvarez criticised the Castro regime for “false promises”, including “free education, free healthcare”. Yes, and so what? Castro was an economic disaster, but governments all over Europe, not to mention Canada and Japan, have provided better education and medical care for their people than the United States has. The systems have various names, but here’s a hint: the most right-wing major party in Germany proudly wears the name Christlich-Soziale Union, in English the Christian-Socialists.   
The speakers at the GOP convention seem to live in another world. “This election is a choice between the far-left Democratic Socialist agenda versus protecting and preserving the American dream,” railed Elise Stefanik, a New York congresswoman. Biden leads to the “path of socialism and decline,” said Vice President Mike Pence. “The Socialist Democrats have a different agenda that will dismantle our institutions, defund our police and destroy our economy,” contended House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. And on it went.  
Ah, but perhaps the Democrats are not like any of the European social democrats. Perhaps they look back to the true Reds like Rosa Luxemburg and Leon Trotsky. Maybe they embrace a programme of asset expropriation where the state controls the means of production, followed by the liquidation of the former ruling class and their bourgeois lackeys.   
Well, not exactly. In fact, not at all. Biden’s economic plan, including more government subsidies for university education and more accessible healthcare, is in line with the established practices of America’s peers.   
Truth is, anyone searching for an example of contemporary socialism need look no further than the Trump administration’s response to the current recession. After all, income redistribution is at the very heart of socialism. And the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES), which was passed by Congress and signed by Trump, provided $2.2 trillion of that. In other words, the government effectively “socialised” much of the income lost in Covid-19-related lockdowns.  
The quantity of Trump’s socialism was exceptional (another buzzword much on display this week), but not the approach. The United States socialises lots of losses. Taxes already pay for most education and healthcare, and the government keeps close control of many other crucial economic levers.   
As far as it goes, citizens are right to complain about the socialisation of the costs of some aspects of the current American way of life: the lost trust in law enforcement, rising civil unrest, and outsized losses of life from drug overdoses, obesity and gun violence. Voters might back a more positive socialised effort to deal with these problems. That’s Germany’s Angela Merkel, not Fidel Castro.   
If the American dream needs preserving, as Stefanik said, the Republican convention was a poor example of how to go about it. There were some upbeat moments, like the president’s pardoning of Jon Ponder, a convicted bank robber. Overall, though, the tone was one of anger and grievance, as in the sweaty lipped attacks of former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and of snarling, as in the speeches delivered by the president’s sons. It was just about the opposite of aspirational.   
Many Republicans mistrust the United Nations, but it would be good for them look at its international comparisons, published annually, of happiness in different nations. The statisticians look at social support systems, healthy life expectancy at birth, freedom to make life choices, generosity and perceptions of corruption.   
Despite its immense wealth, the United States ranked just 18th in the latest ranking. It lagged 12 European nations, including Great Britain, as well as New Zealand, Israel, Australia and Costa Rica, most of which have embraced some form of, whisper the word, socialism.

""I don't think that there should be any debates,"" Pelosi said on Thursday during a press conference on Capitol Hill. ""I do not think that the president of the United States has comported himself in a way that anybody has any association with truth, evidence, data and facts.""
""I wouldn't legitimize a conversation with him nor a debate in terms of the presidency of the United States,"" she added, Xinhua news agency reported.
The top congressional Democrat instead proposed that the candidates take separate stages and answer questions about their policies in a ""conversation with the American people"" rather than ""an exercise in skulduggery"" but acknowledged that the Biden campaign ""thinks in a different way about this.""
Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said that they ""certainly agree with Speaker Pelosi on her views of the president's behaviour,""
""But just as she has powerfully confronted that behaviour in the Oval Office and the Cabinet Room, Joe Biden looks forward to doing the same on the debate stage,"" Bates added.
Trump and his campaign have sought to cast doubt on Biden's mental fitness and pushed for more debates and for them to take place sooner.
In a recent interview with ABC News, Biden, 77, said that he thinks ""it's a legitimate question to ask anybody over 70 years old whether or not they're fit and whether they're ready."" ""But I just, only thing I can say to the American people, it's a legitimate question to ask anybody,"" he said. ""Watch me.""
On Wednesday, Trump said he will request both Biden and himself take drug tests before the first presidential debate in September, suggesting without providing any evidence that drugs had improved the former vice president's debate performance against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in March during the Democratic primary.
""We are going to call for a drug test,"" Trump said during an interview in the Oval Office with the Washington Examiner. ""I don't know how he could have been so incompetent in his debate performances and then all of a sudden be OK against Bernie.""
The Commission on Presidential Debates has scheduled three debates between Biden and Trump and one between Vice President Mike Pence and Biden's running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, in coming two months.

4674902,0,1,"Republican convention praise of Trump economy is risky strategy, poll highlights - Reuters",Donald Trump accepts Republican Party’s re-nomination as presidential candidate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans’ support for President Donald Trump’s management of the economy has slipped, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows, challenging a bedrock re-election argument laid out at the Republican National Convention this week. 
About 58% of respondents said the U.S. economy is on the wrong track in a survey taken August 19 through 25th. 
And for the first time this year, Trump’s net approval on economic issues dipped into negative territory, with 47% saying they approved of his stewardship of the American economy and 48% saying they disapproved. That is down from an approval margin of 14 percentage points in late March. 
While the poll shows Trump still has an edge with voters over Democratic opponent Joe Biden on the economy, the results highlight the risks the Republican Party is taking by leaning on memories of last year’s strong economy and arguing that Trump will easily be able to restore it. 
“Our economic choice is very clear. Do you want economic health, prosperity, opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation, recession and pessimism?” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said at the convention on Tuesday night. 
“Who do you trust to rebuild this economy?,” Vice President Mike Pence asked Wednesday night. “A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world?” 
BOUNCE AHEAD, BUT THEN WHAT? 
Looking to the fall, just as the U.S. witnessed a historic drop here in gross domestic product from April through June, Trump will be able to trumpet a record increase - equivalent to perhaps 25% on an annualized basis - when statistics are released in October covering the July to September period. 
Neither data point, products of a deliberate shutdown of the economy in March and the automatic impact of reopening from that sudden stop, say much about the economic fortunes of families and businesses during the first months of the pandemic, or in the weeks to come. 
The coronavirus health crisis, with nearly 6 million infected and over 175,000 Americans dead, is still raging. The onset of the conventional flu season is on the horizon, and an experiment underway in reopening schools and colleges is already leading to new spikes in infections. 
Consumer confidence, which can influence future economic activity, remains weak. The national unemployment rate at 10.2% in July is the highest in 39 years, and improvement seems to be slowing. Nearly 15 million Americans are receiving unemployment benefits, the highest on record and double the number hit during the 2007 to 2009 Great Recession. 
The blow has been received hardest among groups including blacks, Hispanics and women who benefited most from last year’s record low unemployment rate. Continued support among white women in particular will be critical to Trump’s electoral chances. 
TRUMP EDGE OVER BIDEN 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll found most voters would not currently back Biden on the economy. 
Trump’s team has been hammering Biden’s discussion of tax policies to pay for rising government debt due to the Trump administration’s earlier tax cuts. 
Among registered voters, Trump still has a five-point edge over Biden in who would be better to manage the economy. 
But the poll also found 30% of Republicans felt the economy was on the wrong track, the highest since February 2018 when Reuters/Ipsos started tracking the question. 
The poll gathered responses from 4,428 American adults, including 1,929 Democrats, 1,750 Republicans and 430 independents. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of between 2-5 percentage points. 
If the economic impact of the pandemic has been in some ways less severe than feared, with household spending returning to pre-pandemic levels and Americans boosting their savings, it is only because of massive government spending and a larger federal footprint in the economy. 
Both Republican and Democratic leaning economists feel much more federal help and a larger federal footprint will be needed to avoid a deeper slide this fall - steps that Trump would have to embrace even as he tries to brand Biden a “socialist.” 
The lapse of $600 a week unemployment benefits, the expiration of loans for small businesses, and the lack of help for state and local governments may in short order pull the rug from economic data that has been more positive than expected since a wave of business lockdowns and social distancing measures in April. 
A Census survey in July said reported “food insecurity” rose more than 20% early in the pandemic, reaching nearly 30 million. 
As former Fed chair Janet Yellen and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities senior adviser Jared Bernstein said in a New York Times column, a lot more people are hungry. 
Both have been briefing Biden on economic issues, and wrote that without further federal spending, “millions of needy Americans will suffer and the overall economy could degrade from its current slow rebound in growth to no growth at all.”

President Donald Trump accepts the Republican presidential nomination during the final night of the Republican National Convention, on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, on Thursday. (Doug Mills/The New York Times)US President Donald Trump has officially accepted the re-nomination of the Republican Party as its presidential candidate for the November elections, telling his fellow Americans that at no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas.
Trump, 74, in his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House amidst cheers from his supporters on Thursday night, said: “My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States.”
“I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years,” Trump said.
“In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history” quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity!? he said.
Party’s delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
Pence delivered his acceptance speech from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday. This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Addressing an audience of about 1,500 invited guests, Trump said that the Republican Party goes forward united, determined and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
Trump and Pence are being challenged by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin senator Kamala Harris.
Harris, 55, has scripted history by becoming the first African-American and Indian-origin person to be nominated as a vice presidential candidate by a major political party.
As per an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days from now is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump’s acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party, which gathers once in four years in one of the American cities to nominate its presidential candidate.
This year it was scheduled to be held in Charlotte in North Carolina. Due to the restrictions on social gatherings as a result of the coronaviruspandemic, the convention went into a virtual mode, with only essential official business being held in Charlotte.
Popular Indian-American politician Nikki Haley was the star speaker on Monday, the first day. First Lady Melania Trump addressed the convention from Rose Garden of the White House on Tuesday, while Pence delivered his acceptance speech on Wednesday.
Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who is also his presidential advisor, addressed the convention before him on Thursday night.
“He’s our commander-in-chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. He is our president, and my father, Donald J Trump,” Ivanka said.
His son Donald Trump Jr addressed the convention on Monday, while daughter Tiffney and other son Eric addressed the convention on Tuesday and daughter-in-law Lara on Wednesday. A group of protesters had gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House in advance of Trump’s speech.
Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, and his wife were among the special invitees on the South Lawns of the White House for Trump’s acceptance speech. Al Mason said it was amazing spectacular and full of enthusiasm never seen in the Democratic convention last week.

7132333,0,1,"Joe Biden will be destroyer of American greatness, says Donald Trump",US Election 2020: Donald Trump accepts Republican Partys re-nomination as presidential candidate,"Seeking another four years in the White House, US President Donald Trump has slammed Democratic rival Joe Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness.
Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration.
Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: Joe Biden is not the saviour of America's soul.""
He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness.""
Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history, Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election.
Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs, Trump alleged.
During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered.
This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas, he said.
This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades, he said.
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens.
And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it, he said.
Referring to the last week's Democrat National Convention, Trump said that Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice.
So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country? he asked.
In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history, he said.
Trump alleged that for 47 years, Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands.
Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, he alleged.
Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defence, he said.
Trump alleged that as vice president Biden supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry.
He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing (Qasem) Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as ""a positive development"" for America and the world. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win, he said.
China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused, Trump said.
He called Biden a Trojan horse for socialism.
Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden's America, he said, referring to violent protests there.
On November 3, he urged his countrymen to send the Democrats led by Biden a thundering message they will never forget! Joe Biden is weak"".
""He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.

I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years, Trump said.

Party's delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
Pence delivered his acceptance speech from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday. This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Addressing an audience of about 1,500 invited guests, Trump said that the Republican Party goes forward united, determined and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
Trump and Pence are being challenged by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin senator Kamala Harris.
Harris, 55, has scripted history by becoming the first African-American and Indian-origin person to be nominated as a vice presidential candidate by a major political party.
As per an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days from now is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump's acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party, which gathers once in four years in one of the American cities to nominate its presidential candidate.
This year it was scheduled to be held in Charlotte in North Carolina. Due to the restrictions on social gatherings as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the convention went into a virtual mode, with only essential official business being held in Charlotte.
Popular Indian-American politician Nikki Haley was the star speaker on Monday, the first day. First Lady Melania Trump addressed the convention from Rose Garden of the White House on Tuesday, while Pence delivered his acceptance speech on Wednesday.
Trump's daughter Ivanka, who is also his presidential advisor, addressed the convention before him on Thursday night.
He's our commander-in-chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. He is our president, and my father, Donald J Trump, Ivanka said.
His son Donald Trump Jr addressed the convention on Monday, while daughter Tiffney and other son Eric addressed the convention on Tuesday and daughter-in-law Lara on Wednesday. A group of protesters had gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House in advance of Trump's speech.

4674754,0,1,"Republican convention praise of Trump economy is risky strategy, poll highlights - Reuters",Joe Biden's victory will endanger nation and destroy American greatness: Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans’ support for President Donald Trump’s management of the economy has slipped, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows, challenging a bedrock re-election argument laid out at the Republican National Convention this week. 
About 58% of respondents said the U.S. economy is on the wrong track in a survey taken August 19 through 25th. 
And for the first time this year, Trump’s net approval on economic issues dipped into negative territory, with 47% saying they approved of his stewardship of the American economy and 48% saying they disapproved. That is down from an approval margin of 14 percentage points in late March. 
While the poll shows Trump still has an edge with voters over Democratic opponent Joe Biden on the economy, the results highlight the risks the Republican Party is taking by leaning on memories of last year’s strong economy and arguing that Trump will easily be able to restore it. 
“Our economic choice is very clear. Do you want economic health, prosperity, opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation, recession and pessimism?” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said at the convention on Tuesday night. 
“Who do you trust to rebuild this economy?,” Vice President Mike Pence asked Wednesday night. “A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world?” 
BOUNCE AHEAD, BUT THEN WHAT? 
Looking to the fall, just as the U.S. witnessed a historic drop here in gross domestic product from April through June, Trump will be able to trumpet a record increase - equivalent to perhaps 25% on an annualized basis - when statistics are released in October covering the July to September period. 
Neither data point, products of a deliberate shutdown of the economy in March and the automatic impact of reopening from that sudden stop, say much about the economic fortunes of families and businesses during the first months of the pandemic, or in the weeks to come. 
The coronavirus health crisis, with nearly 6 million infected and over 175,000 Americans dead, is still raging. The onset of the conventional flu season is on the horizon, and an experiment underway in reopening schools and colleges is already leading to new spikes in infections. 
Consumer confidence, which can influence future economic activity, remains weak. The national unemployment rate at 10.2% in July is the highest in 39 years, and improvement seems to be slowing. Nearly 15 million Americans are receiving unemployment benefits, the highest on record and double the number hit during the 2007 to 2009 Great Recession. 
The blow has been received hardest among groups including blacks, Hispanics and women who benefited most from last year’s record low unemployment rate. Continued support among white women in particular will be critical to Trump’s electoral chances. 
TRUMP EDGE OVER BIDEN 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll found most voters would not currently back Biden on the economy. 
Trump’s team has been hammering Biden’s discussion of tax policies to pay for rising government debt due to the Trump administration’s earlier tax cuts. 
Among registered voters, Trump still has a five-point edge over Biden in who would be better to manage the economy. 
But the poll also found 30% of Republicans felt the economy was on the wrong track, the highest since February 2018 when Reuters/Ipsos started tracking the question. 
The poll gathered responses from 4,428 American adults, including 1,929 Democrats, 1,750 Republicans and 430 independents. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of between 2-5 percentage points. 
If the economic impact of the pandemic has been in some ways less severe than feared, with household spending returning to pre-pandemic levels and Americans boosting their savings, it is only because of massive government spending and a larger federal footprint in the economy. 
Both Republican and Democratic leaning economists feel much more federal help and a larger federal footprint will be needed to avoid a deeper slide this fall - steps that Trump would have to embrace even as he tries to brand Biden a “socialist.” 
The lapse of $600 a week unemployment benefits, the expiration of loans for small businesses, and the lack of help for state and local governments may in short order pull the rug from economic data that has been more positive than expected since a wave of business lockdowns and social distancing measures in April. 
A Census survey in July said reported “food insecurity” rose more than 20% early in the pandemic, reaching nearly 30 million. 
As former Fed chair Janet Yellen and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities senior adviser Jared Bernstein said in a New York Times column, a lot more people are hungry. 
Both have been briefing Biden on economic issues, and wrote that without further federal spending, “millions of needy Americans will suffer and the overall economy could degrade from its current slow rebound in growth to no growth at all.” 
Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Heather Timmons and Alistair Bell","Washington: Seeking another four years in the White House, US President Donald Trump has slammed Democratic rival Joe Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness. 
Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration. 
Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: ""Joe Biden is not the saviour of America's soul."" 
""He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness."" 
""Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history,"" Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate. 
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election. 
""Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs,"" Trump alleged. 
During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). 
Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered. 
""This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" he said.

2272182,0,1,"JEE-NEET row: ‘Listen to students’ voices,’ Sonia urges Centre as Cong holds nationwide protests - Hindustan Times",6 ministers of Oppn-ruled states move SC seeking review of NEET-JEE order,"The Congress on Friday held nationwide protests over Centre’s decision to hold the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) in September. Party chief Sonia Gandhi urged the government to listen to the voices of students and act according to their wishes.
Opposition parties such as the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, the Shiv Sena and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) have demanded that NEET and JEE exams be deferred due to the Covid-19 pandemic and floods in parts of the country.
However, the central government has repeatedly made it clear that the exams will be held as per schedule with due precautions.
Six ministers of opposition-ruled states – West Bengal, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand - on Friday also moved the Supreme Court seeking review of its order allowing the Centre to hold NEET and JEE exams.
The Congress also held an online campaign - ‘Speak Up For Student Safety’ – with its leaders and workers extending support to the students on the social media.

“I feel for you because you are now facing a very difficult situation. The issue of your exams, of when they should be taken up is the most important issue, not only for you but for your family,” Sonia Gandhi said in her video message to the students. 
“You are our future. We depend on you to build a better India. Therefore, if any decision has to be taken regarding students’ future, it is important that it is being taken with your concurrence,” she added.
“I hope the government listens to you, listens to your voices and acts upon your wishes. This is my advice to the government,” Sonia Gandhi said in the nearly a minute-long video posted on the party’s Twitter handle.
The NEET is slated to be held on September 13, while engineering entrance exam JEE-main is scheduled between September 1 and 6. The Supreme Court had last week dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the two exams, saying, a “precious academic year of students cannot be wasted and life has to go on”. 
Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi also urged the government to hold a conversation with students and take a decision after arriving at a consensus.
“NEET-JEE aspirants’ safety should not be compromised due to the failures of the government. Government must listen to all stakeholders and arrive at a consensus,” he tweeted.
Rahul Gandhi also tagged a video of him urging the government to listen to students and take a decision only after reaching a consensus. 
“You are the students and you are going to take this country to new heights. Everybody understands what has happened over the last three or four months,” he said.
“Everybody understands the mishandling of Covid-19, the devastation that has been caused, the economic destruction, the pain that this country has had to bear. Now what I don’t understand is why you should be held responsible and why further pain should be imposed on you,” Rahul Gandhi told the students.
He alleged that the government has been incompetent, and asked why should the Centre force anything on students.
“It is important that the government listens to the students, they are wise, they have the interest of this country at heart and any decision that is made with regard to these exams is made after a conversation and after a consensus has been developed and this is my message to the government,” he said.
Rahul Gandhi urged the government to have a conversation with students and resolve this issue peacefully.
Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the government cannot ignore the voices of students and those of their concerned parents. 
“They are the future of our country. With the rising scale of the pandemic, is it fair to expose them to infection in this manner? Are they not our children too?” she asked.
Among those who joined the party’s online campaign by posting their messages and videos on the social media were senior party leaders such as Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mukul Wasnik, Shashi Tharoor, Manish Tewari, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Jitin Prasada and Raj Babbar.
Later addressing a joint virtual press conference with Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren said the Centre claims that thousands of students have downloaded their admit cards. 
“I don’t understand what kind of argument is this. If that is the case, then if someone has the life insurance, does it mean that he will die soon?” he asked.
Singhvi said these six states represent not only 30 percent of India’s population, but also represent 30 percent of India’s geographical area.
“The mental status of our students, mental situation, mental illness and mental situation is probably more important than physical constraints. They are under pressure, they are under pain, they are under fear, with 6 months of Covid and they are suddenly forced because you threw yourself into a corner, without thinking of alternative for 3-4 months, into a sudden press button, magic button kind of thinking - start giving exams from September 1,” he said. 
O’ Brien said the petitioners do not want the students to lose the academic year and the petition aims to ensure better safety and security measures for the students.","Six ministers of opposition ruled states -- West Bengal, Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand -- have jointly filed a review petition in the Supreme Court challenging its August 17 order declining to entertain pleas seeking postponement of NEET-JEE exams slated in September in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic.
The petition has been filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes and it contends the top court's order to ""secure the safety, security and right to life of the students -- candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE exams.""
The petition argues that the top court has ignored the teething logistical difficulties in conducting the examinations at the proposed dates.
""Failed to balance the competing but equally important aspects of conducting the examination and securing safety of the student. Fails to ensure that mandatory safeguards are put in place during the conducting of the examinations,"" said the petition challenging the August 17 order.
""The advice of 'Life Must Go On' may have sounded very philosophical underpinnings but cannot be a substitute for valid legal reasoning and logical analysis of the various aspects involved in the conduct of the NEET (UG) and JEE exams,"" argued the petitioners.
The petitioners said the apex court failed to appreciate that the Centre had adequate time to establish at least one centre for every district for NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) rather than having several centres in one district.
""Having at least one centre per district would have minimised the inter-district long travel of the students and thereby reduced the chances of Covid-19 spread,"" argued the petitioners.
The petitioners contended that if the August 17 order is not reviewed then grave and irreparable harm and injury would befall on the student community of the country and it will impact health, welfare and safety of the students/candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE examinations.
""With regards to the second reason of losing a year, it is most respectfully submitted that this would be tantamount to putting the cart before the horse, as the submissions hereinabove have revealed.
""The Review Petitioners too do not desire for the students to lose an academic year, but wish to balance their health, safety and security and that of their family with not losing the current academic year,"" said the petition.
The Petitioner number one is Moloy Ghatak -- Minister-in-Charge, Department of Labour &amp; E.S.I. (MB) Scheme and Departments of Law &amp; Judicial, Government of West Bengal.
Petitioner number two is Dr. Rameshwar Oraon -- Cabinet Minister of Finance, Government of Jharkhand.
Petitioner number three is Dr. Raghu Sharma -- Cabinet Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Rajasthan.
Petitioner number four is Amarjeet Bhagat -- Minister of Food, Civil supplies, Culture, Planning, Economics &amp; Statistics, Government of Chhattisgarh.
Petitioner number five is Balbir Singh Sidhu -- Cabinet Minister Health and Family Welfare &amp; Labour, Government of Punjab.
Petitioner number six is Uday Ravindra Samant -- Minister of Higher and Technical Education, Government of Maharashtra.

7512164,0,1,"No masks. social distancing: At GOP's convention, Covid is largely ignored",Donald Trump accepts Republican Party’s re-nomination as presidential candidate,"It was a stunning scene in a country where parents and children have been laid to rest without their loved ones present, schools have gone to online-only learning and businesses have shut their doors to halt the spread of the coronavirus.
On Thursday night, about 1,500 people gathered on the South Lawn of the White House so President Donald Trump could accept his party's nomination for reelection in front of a roaring crowd.
Masks were not required and chairs were placed inches apart from one another, with no room for social distancing, in violation of endless public health recommendations.
Only those the White House expected to be in ""close proximity"" to the president and vice president had been tested for COVID-19.
As Trump has tried to push past a pandemic that has tanked the economy and threatened his reelection chances, GOP organisers have worked to stage a convention that puts the virus in the rear view mirror and highlights the nation's progress, even as it continues to spread.
More than 42,000 new cases were reported Wednesday and 2,700 more have died since the week began.
But few convention speakers made reference to the virus, while others have discussed it in the past tense.
It was awful. Health and economic impacts were tragic, said White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on the convention's second night. But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.
The display stands in jarring contrast with the Democrats, who dispensed with audiences at live speeches during their virtual convention last week.
Presidential nominee Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris also wore masks, even when they were outside and standing apart from one another.
Is coronavirus gone? Is COVID-19 gone? Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders asked Thursday on a call with reporters. I didn't see any masks or social distancing happening during the vice president's speech last night. So, the reality is, there is a lack of leadership here.
To be sure, the Republicans' event looked very different from past conventions. Because of the virus, the GOP cancelled what would have been mass gatherings drawing thousands to North Carolina or Florida, and they have been consulting with a coronavirus adviser. Indoor speeches were delivered without audiences. But outdoor events have featured guests.
That included a Rose Garden address Tuesday by first lady Melania Trump, who spoke about the toll of the virus, and Vice President Mike Pence's speech Wednesday, delivered in front of about 100 people, including Pence's family and wounded veterans, at Fort McHenry in Baltimore.
After Pence had spoken, a scene unfolded that seemed from a bygone era, as audience members moved from their chairs and gathered near the stage to greet him, Trump and their wives.
While the president and first lady appeared to keep their distance, Pence was seen shaking hands, exchanging fist bumps, and at one point accepting a small gift from an audience member. No one appeared concerned about social distancing. Few in the crowd were seen wearing masks. And some told reporters they had not been tested for the virus before attending the speech.
The White House and campaign refused to say how many in attendance at the events had been tested for the virus. White House spokesman Judd Deere said only that those in close proximity to the president and vice president are screened.
And while Washington, DC, mandates that masks be worn in public places, guidance sent to those invited to Thursday's event specified that masks would not be required on the South Lawn, though they would be needed upon arrival and in security screening areas and encouraged in high traffic areas including restrooms and hospitality spaces.
Guests were also asked to practice social distancing whenever possible and stay home if they were displaying coronavirus symptoms, had recently tested positive for the virus or had been in recent close contact with someone who had.
Robert G Darling, who served a physician to former President Bill Clinton and is the chief medical officer of the Patronus Medical Corp, said the group has been working with the RNC on the convention to make certain proper protocols are in place to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals at convention venues"".
He said those protocols are in line with city and federal guidelines and that health professionals have been on-site to make certain screening has been done on a consistent basis to ensure the convention meets the highest standards of public safety"".
But the refusal to abide by other widely accepted mitigation recommendations including those promoted by the president's own heath agencies confounded public health experts watching at home.
The president and the entire RNC, they had an opportunity to show the seriousness of this pandemic, which is the worst public health crisis in our lifetimes, and it's extremely concerning that only did they not discuss precautions like wearing masks and social distancing, they are going against all of our public health guidance,"" said Dr Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy at The George Washington University and the former health commissioner of Baltimore.

6822728,0,1,Markets higher as Fed chair says interest rates to stay low,METALS-Copper edges higher as Fed shifts inflation target - Reuters Africa,"Asian markets were mostly higher on Friday after the Federal Reserve said it might keep interest rates low even if inflation rises, in a major overhaul to its strategy.
Shares rose in Japan, South Korea, Shanghai and Hong Kong but fell in Sydney.
Overnight, the S&amp;P 500 ticked 0.2% higher, further into record territory and closing at 3,484.55, after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said in a speech that it might keep interest rates low to help prop up the pandemic ravaged economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2%.
The hoped for change in the Fed's strategy is a huge deal for markets that have been rescued by central banks slashing short-term interest rates and buying all kinds of bonds.
Japan's consumer price index rose 0.3% in July, the government reported, down from 0.6% the month before.
The Bank of Japan has kept interest rates near or even below zero for most of the past decade, seeking to spur inflation and entice companies and consumers to spend more. It has yet to see inflation hit the 2% target set by its governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, in 2013.
Kuroda has said he will do what he can to support the economy but that central bank policy cannot ensure sustainable long-term growth.
The disruptions dealt by the coronavirus pandemic have pushed many economies into downturns, causing demand and upward pressure on prices to soften. Low interest rates keep credit cheap to encourage investment and other spending.
With the adoption of allowing inflation to overshoot their target, the Fed is slowly becoming the BOJ,"" Edward Moya of Oanda said in a commentary. The Fed did not give any hints on how they will achieve inflation and that is why no one is buying that it will happen anytime soon.""
In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index gained 0.4% to 23,292.80 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.6% to 25,428.47. The Kospi in Seoul jumped 1.1% to 2,369.73. Sydney's S&amp;P/ASX 200 was flat, at 6,067.90, while the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher, to 3,352.58.
Shares fell in Taiwan but rose in Southeast Asia.
On Wall Street, prices for stocks, bonds and gold all made several U-turns after Powell's highly anticipated speech. In it, he essentially said the Fed may continue efforts to prop up the economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2%, as long as it had been weak before then.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6% to 28,492.27, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.3% to 11,625.34 after paring an earlier loss of 1%.
With its fifth straight day of gains, the S&amp;P 500's has climbed 56% since late March after the immense support of the Fed helped halt its earlier free-fall and erase its pandemic losses.
Low interest rates often act like steroids for stocks, allowing their prices to rise faster than corporate profits.
The era of easy money is here, said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury was at 0.78%, up from 0.68% late Wednesday. The 30-year yield climbed to 1.50% from 1.41%.
A report Thursday showed the pace of layoffs sweeping the country remains incredibly high but may be slowing. A little more than 1 million US workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, down slightly from just over 1.1 million the week before.
In another report, the government also said that the economy looks like it shrank at an annual rate of 31.7% in the spring quarter. That would be the sharpest quarterly drop on record, but it's not as bad as the Commerce Department's earlier estimate of 32.9%.
Financial stocks had the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;P 500, up 1.7%. A higher 10-year Treasury yield allows for higher rates on mortgages and other loans, which boosts profits for banks. JPMorgan Chase gained 3.3%, and Wells Fargo rose 2.3%.
Benchmark US crude oil lost 5 cents to $42.99 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell 35 cents to settle at $43.04 per barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 1 cent to $45.61 per barrel.
In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar bought 106.91 Japanese yen, down from 106.57 yen late Thursday. The euro rose to $1.1844 from $1.1823.
(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","Aug 28 (Reuters) - Copper rose on Friday after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would promote higher inflation, a move that could weaken the dollar and make greenback-priced commodities more attractive. 
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange advanced 0.3% to $6,640 a tonne by 0143 GMT and was on track for a third straight weekly gain, while the most-traded October copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 0.5% to 51,790 yuan ($7,513.96) a tonne. 
The Fed on Thursday introduced new monetary policy which would likely keep interest rate low and pressure the dollar , which has been hovering around a two-year low.

774098,0,1,"Donald Trump promises Covid-19 vaccine by end of this year, or sooner","Trump, Republicans attack Biden amid coronavirus crisis, street protests","US President Donald Trump vowed to ""crush"" Covid-19 with a vaccine by the end of the year, as he accepted the Republican nomination for a second term as the country's leader. The US President said that the country is roped in deft scientist to develop the vaccines for coronavirus under 'Operation Warp Speed'.
""We are marshaling America's scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time. We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year and together we will crush the virus,” Trump said, adding that three cvaccines will be ready for production soon and could be made available this year.
Trump said, “We are getting our scientists to develop vaccines under 'Operation Warp Speed'. We have 3 vaccines that will be available for production soon and they will be available this year.” He also said the US has conducted the highest number of Covid-19 tests, 40 million, much more than any other country with India being the second largest.
Trump, in his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention which re-nominated him as the Republican Party's presidential candidate, said that the US has conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation which is India.
“We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma,” he said on Thursday night.
“You saw that on Sunday night when we announced that we'll save thousands and thousands of lives. Thanks to advances, we have pioneered the fatality rate. And you look at it and you look at the numbers, it has been reduced by 80 per cent since April,” he said.

Trump delivered his speech to a group of over 1,000 supporters on the South Lawn of the White House. Many did not wear face masks and were seated close together.
The US is among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world, Trump said.
“The European Union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours, but you don't hear that. They don't write about that. They don't want to write about that. They don't want you to know those things.
“All together, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30 per cent greater increase and excess mortality than the United States,” said the president.
In recent months, the United States and the world has been hit by the once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe.
“They could have stopped it but they allowed it to come out. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude,” he said.
Criticising his Democratic Party rival Joe Biden, Trump said unlike the former vice president, his administration focuses “on the science, the facts and the data” to handle the coronavirus pandemic. “If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.,,,,"" Trump, who had earlier dismissed the pandemic as not a major health issue for the country, said.
Many Americans, including him, sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease, Trump said.
“As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that had been so tragically taken. So unnecessary.
“In their honour, we will unite. In their memory, we will overcome. And when the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilisation since World War II. Invoking the Defence Production Act, we produced the world's largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator which is a miracle,” Trump added.
More than 180,000 people have died from the coronavirus pandemic since the start of the outbreak in the US, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
Nearly 5.8 million cases have also been confirmed nationwide, making America the worst-hit country in the world after the disease emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year.
Trump repeatedly claimed there would be a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, and also implied it could be available sooner.
“We are delivering life-saving therapies, and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner,” Trump said at one point.
“We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before.
“Nobody thought it could ever be done this fast. We are producing them in advance, so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available,"" Trump said.
“We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year,” Trump assured, “and together we will crush the virus.” ""Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticise,"" Trump said.
""When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died,"" he said.
According to the India's Union Health Ministry data, India's COVID-19 tally stands at 33,87,500 while the death toll at 61,529.
A cumulative total of 3,94,77,848 samples have been tested up to August 27 with 9,01,338 samples being tested on Thursday in India, according to the ministry's data.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, accepting the Republican nomination for a second term, said on Thursday that he alone stands as a bulwark against the forces of socialism, anarchy and extremism that his Democratic rival Joe Biden would champion if elected in November. 
Speaking from the White House South Lawn despite criticism he was using the executive residence as a political prop, Trump asserted that a Biden victory would only worsen the crises besieging the country. 
“This election will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny.” Trump said on the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention. “This election will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans, or whether we give free rein to violent anarchic agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens.” 
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, Trump delivered his remarks in front of more than 1,000 people, standing in front of dozens of American flags and basking in chants of “Four more years!” and “U.S.A.!” 
Though an incumbent seeking a second four-year term, Trump remains a self-styled outsider, an approach that won him the White House, his first elected office, in 2016 on a promise to end the crime and violence he said was afflicting the country. 
On Thursday, he and other Republican speakers argued that state and city Democratic leaders, not the Trump administration, were to blame for the racial strife convulsing U.S. cities, including Kenosha, Wisconsin, where this week police shot and paralysed a Black man. 
“No one will be safe in Biden’s America,” Trump said despite the surge of unrest during his watch. 
As the night unfolded, Biden struck back on Twitter, writing, “When Donald Trump says tonight you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump’s America?” 
The made-for-television scene - befitting the first reality TV host to serve as president - stood in marked contrast to Biden’s acceptance speech last week, which was broadcast live from a largely empty arena in a nod to the disease. 
The crowd, seated in white chairs inches apart, showed little evidence of social distancing or face masks despite health experts’ recommendations. 
The coronavirus prompted both political parties to scale back their conventions and make events mostly virtual. The Trump campaign said it had taken appropriate health precautions. 
In a reminder of the country’s divisions, attendees could hear anti-Trump protesters at nearby Black Lives Matter Plaza as he spoke. 
MORE THAN 180,000 DEATHS 
More than 180,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus - more than any other country, according to a Reuters tally - amid a fresh wave of protests over the latest high-profile police shooting of a Black American. 
In Kenosha, relative calm returned after three nights of civil strife ending on Tuesday, including arson, vandalism and deadly shootings. 
Trump, a former New York real estate developer, is seeking to turn around a re-election campaign that has been largely overshadowed by a health crisis that has put millions of Americans out of work. 
In his speech on Thursday, Trump repeated his assertion that China is to blame for the pandemic and promised to rebuild what Republicans have called the “greatest economy” in history. But opinion polls have shown most Americans are disappointed in his response to the coronavirus, which he played down for weeks. 
While his approval rating among Republican voters remains high, dissent is mounting within the party. In three open letters being published on Thursday and Friday, Biden won endorsements from more than 160 people who worked for Republican former President George W. Bush or for past Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, the New York Times and Politico reported. 
Earlier this week, 27 former Republican lawmakers endorsed Biden while the Lincoln Project, among the most prominent Republican-backed groups opposing Trump, said a former Republican Party head had joined it as a senior adviser. 
Thursday’s program aimed to counterbalance those defections, featuring a video showcasing former Democratic voters who say they now support Trump and remarks from U.S. Representative Jeff Van Drew, who abandoned the Democratic Party to join the Republicans after voting against Trump’s impeachment this year. 
“Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,” he said. 
The program also included several emotional appeals, including from the parents of Kayla Mueller, an aid worker who died after being held captive for months by Islamic State militants in Syria. The Mueller parents said they blamed the Obama administration for failing to rescue Mueller. 
The Republican convention has attracted fewer television viewers than its Democratic counterpart on two of its three nights so far, including on Wednesday, according to early Nielsen Media Research. 
A total of 17.3 million people watched the third night of the mostly virtual Republican National Convention on Wednesday, according to Nielsen, fewer than the 22.8 million viewers for the third night of last week’s Democratic convention. 
Trump kicked off the week on Monday by accusing Democrats of seeking to steal the election by advocating for mail-in voting. His previous high-profile speeches have also emphasized grim themes, including his inaugural address in January 2017 that described “American carnage.”

Normal"" life, whatever that may mean, has resumed to varying extents: shops are open, our nearby tennis courts have not; people throng seaside promenades for walks, the police clear them off by 7pm; you can in general eat your favourite restaurants fare, but not on the premises.All signs that while theres still great need for caution, you cant keep an economy on lockdown indefinitely.
Still, perhaps theres a need for some stocktaking. In particular, since theres so much about a pandemic thats to do with data, what do we learn from the data, six months into this pandemic? What do the numbers tell us about how weve coped with it?
In this column, a few random observations and reactions purely from poring over the covid numbers.
* Odishas health minister Naba Kishore Das pronounced recently that the states low fatality rate [due to covid] reflects our success in managing the pandemic"". Some part of this is true: the highest death-by-covid count on any single day in Odisha is just 16, on 10 August. For the three weeks since then, it has hovered around 10. But remember that Odishas chief minister Naveen Patnaik made more or less the same point on 28 May his states mortality rate, he told us, was one of the lowest in the world"". He was right: at that time, Odishas number of daily deaths varied between zero and two not 10, not 16 and that rock-bottom level continued till the end of June. But after that, it rose steadily to 16. Why?
* Still with Odisha. Actually those death counts must be compared to the case counts to determine the fatality rate, and so whether it is actually low. Doing that, we find both Odisha ministers were right: the states fatality rate is low indeed. But that masks something else about Odishas brush with covid. The count of new cases in that state was also relatively small for a long time: in the four months, from the beginning of March till the end of June, it had risen only to somewhere between 175 and 250 every day. (Compare to Maharashtra, which at the end of June was adding about 5,000 cases every day more than 20 times Odishas count).
But suddenly on July 3, Odishas new case count more than doubled to 561. Since then, theres been a steady and relentless rise, with an occasional leap upwards thrown in. Odishas case count is now increasing at nearly 3,000 a day. (Maharashtra is now at about 10,500 a day, less than four times Odishas count). Why this steep rise? Is that answered by the fact that Odisha allowed a Jagannath Yatra to take place in late June, just days before the 3 July leap?
* Delhi was the first state in the country and for weeks, the only one whose daily new case count seemed to have peaked. That peak was 3,947 cases, on 23 June. Since then, Delhi numbers have declined steadily. Does Delhi hold lessons for the rest of the country? Possibly. The fly in that particular ointment, though, is that the decline seems to have stalled, or flattened out. Since about the beginning of August, daily new cases are holding steady at between 1,000 and 1,500, maybe even trending slightly upwards. Whats the explanation here?
* Still, no longer is Delhi alone in having apparently peaked. In recent weeks, some other states are showing signs that their new case counts have peaked as well. Take Tamil Nadu. New cases were at nearly 7,000 on 27 July, declined somewhat after that and the daily count has been steady at about 6,000 since. Thats a month at the 6,000 level. Its a good thing the number isnt increasing, but why isnt it decreasing? If this is a peak, its a long and flat one.
* Then theres Andhra Pradesh. After a high of nearly 10,820 cases on 9 August, the graph suggests the tide is turning, but slowly and not yet definitively. On 17 August it was about 6,800 cases, but since then theres been an uptick, with 10,300 on 22 August and 10,000 on 25 August. Is the uptick just temporary? Was the peak itself a false one?
* Bihar looks like its over the hump. For a long time, this state looked like it had escaped the real force of the pandemic. Daily new cases were in the low three-digits as recently as the first week of July. But there was a steep rise after that a tripling in five days, a ten-fold increase in a month. On 11 August, Bihar registered just over 4,000 new cases. But since then, daily numbers have dropped and are under 2,000 now.
* And wait, theres Assam. It had a peak of nearly 4,600 new cases on 12 August, though that is a clear aberration, an outlier. Thats because on the days just before and just after 12 August, Assam saw numbers like 2,700-2,800. Not only that, the upward trend in the weeks before, and the downward trend afterwards, suggest a peak of about 3,000 that day; so that 4,600 was indeed an aberration. New cases have now dropped below 2,000 a day, so its possible Assam has peaked as well.
* Goa and Punjab are the only other states that are hinting at having peaked.
* Telangana reported zero new cases on 26 July. Thats an obvious mistake, because there were about 1,500 cases on both 25 July and 27 July, and its been broadly rising since then (nearly 2,500 on 22 August, an all-time high). Every other tracked number for Telangana the deaths, the recoveries, the number tested stayed stubbornly at zero that day. Why that, and why has it not been corrected? I have found just one news report that mentions this, and it says simply that Telangana did not disclose its numbers that day.""
Has this had any effect on overall trends? Not really. About 1,500 missing cases doesnt seem like a lot, given that Telangana was testing about 15,000 of its citizens every day at the time, and is now testing nearly 40,000 every day; given too that we are well past the 3 million mark for total cases nationwide. But it remains a mistake, a statistical aberration. Will it ever be fixed?
* At the end of July, Gujarat briefly held out hope that its rise in cases had peaked. Daily numbers started declining from about 1,150. But that didnt last long. Within a few days, they started climbing again and are now back to that apparent peak.
These numbers and trends should be seen in the light of a report from 23 August. It said that since March, the Gujarat health department has distributed a homeopathic drug called Arsenicum Album-30 to 34.8 million people in the state more than half the states population as a prophylaxis against covid-19. Now the graph of Gujarats daily cases since March is a steady increase that hasnt really slowed at all, that false peak notwithstanding. That itself tells the story of just how effective this prophylaxis has been. But even the report underlines this: There is no scientific evidence that the drug works against covid-19, a fact stressed not only by medical scientists but by some homeopathic practitioners themselves.""
Why did the Gujarat government decide to hand out ineffective pills to so many people in that state?
* As a whole, India is now adding about 65,000 new covid cases a day. If that sounds like a lot, remember its a daily increase of just over 2%. Theres been a long decline in this growth rate. (Through July, for example, it hovered at around 3.5%.) The decline means theres a peak coming, though I cant predict when.
In the meantime, lets remember: even at 2%, this remains exponential growth, and thus worrying. Besides, remember, too, that over 3 million Indians have been infected. Nearly 60,000 have died. These numbers put us at or near the top of world covid rankings. We are #1 in daily new cases, will likely overtake Brazil to #2 in total cases by mid-September, will likely overtake Mexico to #3 in deaths today. Yet it isnt because of the rankings that all this should be alarming the numbers themselves do that job. Covid has killed far more Indians than, for example, terrorism has managed to do in all our independent years.
Yet the absence of any significant outcry against this carnage suggests that we have and maybe our government has decided that, in Donald Trumps famous recent words, it is what it is"". Nearly 200,000 Americans killed by covid, yet he believes that his government has fought the disease and won. Will nearly 60,000 Indians killed by covid persuade us Indians any differently?
Questions, questions.

496425,0,1,Osaka surprised by impact of her call for racial justice - Reuters UK,"Naomi Osaka, Coco Gauff rematch could happen in US Open’s third round","(Reuters) - Naomi Osaka said on Friday she never thought her call for racial justice would garner the attention it did and she does not want to be called brave for taking a stand that led to a one-day stoppage at this week’s U.S. Open tune-up event in New York. 
The 22-year-old Japanese had initially said she would not play her Thursday semi-final in a bid to spark a conversation about racism following the police shooting of a Black man in Wisconsin last week. 
Officials then suspended that day’s matches and on Friday Osaka walked on the court for her semi-final wearing a T-shirt with a picture of a clenched fist and the words “Black Lives Matter” on the front. 
Osaka said she thought the reaction to her stance was something more reserved for some of the game’s bigger names like Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams. 
“It’s definitely a bit eye-opening but in an odd way, because I only previously thought, like, the Big Three and Serena would have that type of power,” Osaka said after booking a spot in Saturday’s Western &amp; Southern Open final. 
“But also, at the same time, I recognise the fact that maybe the WTA and ATP wanted to do something like this but they needed a push from a player to do something like this? So maybe I was sort of their, you know, that one player.” 
Osaka said she made a promise to herself during the sport’s nearly five-month COVID-19 hiatus to not be shy in the future when it came to speaking her mind. 
“During quarantine, the biggest thing I thought was, like, when I get out of this, I want to grow as a person and I don’t want to have that many regrets going forward,” said Osaka. 
“I’m not sure if it’s a light bulb or if there was any particular moment that sparked me to speak up, but I do feel like it’s been building for a while.” 
After posting her announcement on Wednesday, Osaka said it was a bit frightening and that she had to turn off her phone because she gets anxious whenever people talk about her. 
“I don’t feel like I’m being brave. I just feel like I’m doing what I should be doing,” she added. 
“Honestly, when people say courageous or anything, I don’t really resonate that well with it. I just feel like not common sense, but this is what I am supposed to be doing in this moment.”

Naomi Osaka, who won the 2018 US Open and 2019 Australian Open, beat Coco Gauff, then just 15, 6-3, 6-0 in the third round at Flushing Meadows a year ago. (AP/File Photo) American teenager Coco Gauff and two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka could face each other at the US Open again after Thursdays draw for the Grand Slam tournament set up a possible third-round rematch.
The US Tennis Association quietly posted the womens and mens singles draws online, without the usual TV hoopla.
The draw was announced on the same day all matches in the Western &amp; Southern Open — being played at the US Open site because of the coronaviruspandemic — were called off following Osakas decision Wednesday to drop out of her semifinal in response to the shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, by police in Wisconsin.
Osaka changed course Thursday, saying she would play when the Western &amp; Southern Open resumes Friday because the tournaments pause helped call attention to the issues of racial injustice and police brutality.
The US Open is scheduled to begin Monday, without any spectators.
Osaka, who won the 2018 US Open and 2019 Australian Open, beat Gauff, then just 15, 6-3, 6-0 in the third round at Flushing Meadows a year ago.
As tears welled in Gauffs eyes at the end of the match, Osaka offered a hug and words of consolation, then told the teen to address the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd. It was one of the most indelible moments of last years tournament.

I have honestly not talked about it with her. It just feels like it was like a natural thing, and its kind of in the past, Osaka said this week. For me, I dont really dwell on it, and I dont think she does, either. Its not in a negative way, but its just, like — for me, its just really cool to see someone rising up like that, and thats just something that I did, like, genuinely in the moment.
They met again at the Australian Open in January, with Gauff coming out on top.
If the No. 4-seeded Osaka or the unseeded Gauff reaches the quarterfinals, the opponent at that stage could be No. 6 Petra Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion.
Other potential womens quarterfinals: No. 1 seed Karolina Pliskova vs. No. 8 Petra Martic; No. 2 Sofia Kenin vs. No. 5 Aryna Sabalenka; and No. 3 Serena Williams vs. No. 7 Madison Keys.
Only two of the top eight women in the WTA rankings entered the hard-court tournament. Among those missing are No. 1-ranked Ash Barty and 2019 US Open champion Bianca Andreescu.
The defending mens champion, Rafael Nadal, and 20-time Grand Slam title winner Roger Federer are also among those absent in New York this year.
Top-ranked Novak Djokovic did decide to play, though, and was drawn to face 107th-ranked Damir Dzhumhur in the first round.
The mens quarterfinals could be Djokovic vs. No. 7 seed David Goffin; No. 2 Dominic Thiem vs. No. 8 Roberto Bautista Agut; No. 3 Daniil Medvedev vs. No. 6 Matteo Berrettini; and No. 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas vs. No. 5 Alexander Zverev.

Did she siphon off his money? Here are her assertions from Thursdays TV appearances and the counterpoints presented by Sushants family and close friends.
Was Sushant claustrophobic on the flight to Europe?Her claim: On the flight to Europe for their vacation, Sushant said he felt claustrophobic and popped a pill Modafinil which he was already carrying, said Rhea. He also apparently told her that he had visited a psychiatrist in 2013 (Dr Harish Shetty), who had first prescribed the drug.
What they said: Sushants ex-girlfriend, Ankita Lokhande shared a video of Sushant in which he can be seen happily experimenting with his new Boeing 737 Fixed Base Flight Simulator. She wrote, Is this #claustrophobia? You always wanted to fly andou did it and we all are proud of you (sic). She also said, From beginning till the end, me and Sushant were together about 23rd February 2016. He never had any conditions of depression and have visited any psychiatrist (sic).
Was Rhea living off Sushant?Her claim: Rhea denied vehemently that she and her family lived off Sushants money, especially during their Europe trip. She claimed that she had a shoot in Paris with a clothing brand and they had arranged for her business class tickets and stay. But Sushant had those tickets cancelled and booked first-class tickets to turn the work trip also into a vacation. According to Rhea, Sushant lived life king-size and thats the kind of person he was. She also said they lived together like a couple, but she didnt live off him.
What they said: Sushants family has repeatedly claimed that Rhea and her family were living off Sushant and she used to control all aspects of his life, including his finances.
Was she okay with Sushant moving to Coorg and visiting Mumbai just for work? Her claim: According to Rhea, Sushant was keen to shift base to Coorg as he wanted to be away from the chaos of the city. She supported the decision and they were even exploring the option. Rhea said Sushant reached out to his family for help, but they didnt respond. 
What they said: In the FIR filed with the Patna Police, Sushants father KK Singh claimed that his son wanted to settle in Coorg and do farming, but Rhea objected to it and threatened to disclose his medical reports to the media.
Did she isolate Sushant or were his relations with his family strained?Her claim: Rhea said that Sushant had gone to Chandigarh to meet his sisters family (on Jan 20), but returned in two days and that she had no clue he would come back so soon. She said it was because he didnt want to spend time with them. If they felt she was isolating Sushant, they should have stopped him from returning to Mumbai, she countered.
What they said: Sushants sister Shweta Singh Kirti has posted a picture of a ticket booked by her on January 26 to Chandigarh. She wrote on social media: As Rhea mentioned in her interview, We didnt love our brother!! Yeah right, thats why I flew all the way from USA to India in Jan as soon as I got to know Bhai is visiting Chandigarh and is not keeping well. I had to stall my business and leave my kids behind! The worst part was I didnt even get to meet my brother coz by the time I reached, Bhai had already left because of the constant pestering calls of Rhea and some work commitments. Family was always there standing rock solid for him!! Dare anyone ever doubt it for a moment!! (sic)
Was money transferred from Sushants account into Rheas?
Her claim: Rhea says no money had been transferred from any of Sushants accounts to her or her family. In fact, she stressed on the fact that she had paid her own and her brothers share as initial capital in a company, where the two of them were directors along with Sushant.
What they said: In his FIR with Patna Police, Sushants father, KK Singh, has accused Rhea and her family of siphoning off `15 crore from Sushant's account.
What was the drug angle?Her claim: Rhea asserted that she had never given drugs to Sushant, but that he himself used to smoke marijuana, even during the time he was working on Kedarnath. She tried to stop him, but he was the kind of person who did what he felt like, she said.
What they said: Family and their lawyer Vikas Singh have claimed that Rhea was administering drugs to him without his knowledge, with his father claiming that she was trying to poison him.","Sushant Singh Rajput passed away on June 14.Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case is being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

And, Sushant’s flat-mate Siddharth Pithani was called for the seventh consecutive day for questioning.
Meanwhile, Rhea Chakraborty released a video where she showed how her family’s movement has been restricted by the constant presence of mediapersons at her doorstep. She said that she and her family are ready to cooperate with the investigation agencies but urged the Mumbai police to provide them protection. She wrote on Instagram, “There is a threat to my life and my familys life.
Apart from the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing a money-laundering angle into Sushant’s death, now the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has also registered an FIR against Rhea and some others under several sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.

(Express photo)Sharing the dais for the first time since their attempt to form a state government ended within 80 hours in November last year, NCP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, and BJP leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, came together to inaugurate two dedicated Covid care centres in the city.
The first event was held in the Auto Cluster in Pimpri-Chichwad, and the second one in Baner in Pune. At both events, the two leaders spoke about the pandemic situation in the state, and steered clear of any political comments. While Pawar is the guardian minister of Pune district, BJP is the ruling party in both Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation.
In his speech, Pawar said the administration has managed to increase the bed capcity by 2,200 to treat critical Covid patients in the district. The best facility has been set up at the Covid centre in Baner. The centre has come up under the Corporate Social Responsibility initiative, with the complete support of corporate houses, which is worth appreciating, he said.
The NCP leader and Fadnavis jointly felicitated representatives of the corporate firms who contributed to the effort, as well as civic officials, for setting up the centre in such a short span of time.
Fadanavis was accompanied by state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, who is also the MLA from Kothrud, and city MP Girish Bapat. We are going through a challenging situation due to Covid-19 and would come out of it with the combined efforts of everyone, said the leader of opposition.
In comments made after the event, Fadnavis said more testing to screen Covid patients was needed in Mumbai, The situation of Maharashtra is more serious than that of the country. There has to be maximum testing along with effective management of patients for treatment. Testing capacity has been increased in Pune but it still needs to be increased in Mumbai.
He pointed out that the positivity rate in Maharashtra was around 19 per cent, which should be below 5 per cent as per ICMR guidelines, while the mortality rate should be below 1 per cent, but was around 3.2 per cent in the state, higher than the national average.
In November last year, after government formation talks broke down between long-time allies Shiv Sena and BJP, Fadnavis and Pawar had, in a shocking turn of events, taken oath as chief minister and deputy chief minister, respectively. But when asked to prove their majority in the Assembly, both leaders had to resign. The NCP later teamed up with the Sena and Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.
Recently, after Pawar’s son Parth, a NCP leader, triggered controversy by demanding a CBI probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, the opposition BJP had welcomed his comments, leading to speculation that Parth was going to join the party. Both NCP and BJP, however, denied the rumours.

Pune Municipal Corporation’s multi-storey Covid-19 hospital was inaugurated by the leaders. Bhartiya Janta Party’s state unit president Chandrakant Patil was also present along with Fadnavis and Pawar.
As Pawar and Fadnavis attended the hospital event, eyebrows were raised among the political circle. Interestingly, Fadnavis appreciated the work carried out by Pawar in Pune district but was quick to criticise the state government and Shiv Sena on the Covid-19 situation in Mumbai.

Recently Ajit Pawar’s son Parth Pawar, who was defeated from Maval Lok Sabha constituency, supported the BJP’s stand to conduct a CBI inquiry into Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case. Pawar got upset with Parth’s stand and publicly called his son as immature.
Even after the CBI inquiry was initiated in the case, Parth tweeted, “Satya Mev Jayate.”
Despite the president’s rule in force, Ajit Pawar had rebelled from the NCP and joined hands with the BJP last year.

4271518,1,2,Trump has shown reckless disregard for well-being of American people: Kamala Harris,Joe Biden's victory will endanger nation and destroy American greatness: Donald Trump,"By: PTI | Washington | 
Published: August 28, 2020 4:31:52 pm
This was the first major policy attack by Harris against Trump after she was nominated by the Democratic Party as its vice-presidential candidate last week.Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic Party’s vice-presidential candidate, on Thursday blasted President Donald Trump for having “failed” in and “shown reckless disregard” for the well-being of the American people.
“Donald Trump has failed at the most basic and important job of a President of the United States. He failed to protect the American people. Plain and simple. Trump showed what we, in the legal profession, would call a reckless disregard for the well-being of the American people”, Harris said.
In a blistering speech hours before Trump was to the deliver his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention, Harris alleged that the president’s policies have been “a reckless disregard” for the danger a pandemic would pose to American lives.
“For the devastation it would do to our economy. For the damage it would do to communities of color who have been subjected to structural racism for generations. For the chaos that would upend our daily lives, make it impossible for many of our kids to go to school, make it impossible to live normally and with certainty”, she said.
“He never appreciated that a President swears an oath before God and country to protect America against threats seen and unseen. It’s his duty. It’s his obligation to protect us. And yet, he has failed. Miserably”, she said.
“Here’s the thing, Donald Trump’s incompetence is nothing new. That has always been on full display. But in January of this year, it became deadly. That’s when the threat of a virus that would endanger the world first emerged. Trump dismissed the threat. Joe Biden sounded the alarm”, she said.
“It would be the beginning of a pattern that persists to this day. Trump telling us not to worry, that the virus will, quote, ‘disappear’, that a quote, ‘miracle’ is coming. Joe Biden, saying we need a plan, a national strategy, a President who is willing to lead, willing to be a role model for our nation. For our children”, Harris said.
There was no immediate reaction from the president. He was scheduled to deliver his address to Republican National Convention. He and Vice President Mike Pence face challenge from former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate Harris. This was the first major policy attack by Harris against Trump after she was nominated by the Democratic Party as its vice-presidential candidate last week.
Harris alleged that Trump “caved” in when the US needed him to be tough on the Chinese government.
“On January 24th, he praised the transparency of the Chinese government. He said, quote, ‘China has been working hard to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.’ But they weren’t being transparent. They blocked public health inspectors from the CDC, from getting the access and information they needed to protect American lives”, she said.
“Donald Trump stood idly by. And folks, it was a deadly decision. Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Donald Trump froze. He was scared. He was petty and vindictive”, Harris said.
As President, Joe Biden will put a plan into effect on day one, she asserted. “Develop and deploy rapid tests with immediate results. Make sure testing, treatments, and ultimately, a vaccine reach all Americans, including communities of color, who have historically been left behind. Manufacture the medical supplies and protective equipment we need”, she said.
“And make them right here-in America, so we’re never again at the mercy of China and other foreign countries to protect our own people”, she added. A Biden Administration will put in place a nationwide mask Mandate-it’s not a burden to protect each other.
Harris alleged that before the virus hit, Trump made the country vulnerable. “After it was struck, he failed to do what was necessary. As it continues, he’s making it worse every day”, she said.

For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App.","Washington: Seeking another four years in the White House, US President Donald Trump has slammed Democratic rival Joe Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness. 
Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration. 
Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: ""Joe Biden is not the saviour of America's soul."" 
""He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness."" 
""Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history,"" Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate. 
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election. 
""Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs,"" Trump alleged. 
During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). 
Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered. 
""This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" he said. 
""This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades,"" he said. 
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens. 
""And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it,"" he said. 
Referring to the last week's Democrat National Convention, Trump said that Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. 
""So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?"" he asked. 
""In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history,"" he said. 
Trump alleged that for 47 years, Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain - and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands. 
""Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars,"" he alleged. 
""Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defence,"" he said. 
Trump alleged that as vice president Biden supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. 
""He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing (Qasem) Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as ""a positive development"" for America and the world. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win,"" he said. 
""China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused,"" Trump said. 
He called Biden a Trojan horse for socialism. 
""Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden's America,"" he said, referring to violent protests there. 
On November 3, he urged his countrymen to send the Democrats led by Biden a thundering message they will never forget! ""Joe Biden is weak"". 
""He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.",https://indianexpress.com/article/world/trump-reckless-disregard-well-being-american-people-kamala-harris-6573640/,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/joe-bidens-victory-will-endanger-nation-and-destroy-american-greatness-donald-trump/articleshow/77797438.cms
2347929,1,2,"Explained: From Abu Salem to Mehul Choksi, a look at pleas against books and films and their arguments",Delhi HC rejects Choksi's plea for pre-screening of 'Bad Boy Billionaires',"Written by Sadaf Modak
 | 
Published: August 28, 2020 9:03:07 pm
Choski sought a preview of the show stating that he has the right to a fair and free trial and that he had apprehensions that the show could cause prejudice to the trialThe Delhi High Court Friday dismissed a plea filed by fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi, one of the key accused in the alleged Rs 13500-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case, seeking a preview of Netflix documentary Bad Boy Billionaires-India.
The docuseries, which will be released worldwide on September 2, features, among others, Choksi’s nephew Nirav Modi, who is also an accused in the alleged fraud. Choski sought a preview of the show stating that he has the right to a fair and free trial and that he had apprehensions that the show could cause prejudice to the trial.
A look at Choksis petition and other similar petitions or cases by the accused against publication of books or release of films.
What did Mehul Choksi’s petition seek?
Choksi, the promoter of Gitanjali Gems Ltd, who has acquired the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda, submitted to the court that he had seen a trailer of the Netflix show in August and had received calls from various persons across the world to check if he was a part of it.
Choksi claimed he feared that his name may have been used in connection with his nephew Modi, who is featured in the show. He sought a pre-screening to allay these apprehensions and that appropriate reliefs — deletions or disclaimers — be available to him. The counsel for Netflix had told the court that Choksi was in the show only for two minutes, and it was not pertaining to the trial. The platform said that while it was ready to show the series to the court, a pre-screening could not be held for Choksi. The court, however, dismissed the writ petition stating that it was not maintainable since it was against a private entity and an appropriate civil suit could be filed.
On what grounds is relief usually sought against an upcoming book or film?
The basis of seeking relief in such cases is the ground that the publication of a book or a release of a film/documentary/show can cause prejudice to a pending trial. Choksi relied on Article 21 of the Constitution that guarantees equality before law, the presumption of innocence before being found guilty, and a fair and free trial.
Similar relief has been sought in other cases in the past as well. Relief is usually sought on grounds including Article 21 and Article 19, which, while guaranteeing freedom of speech and expression, imposes reasonable restrictions on grounds of contempt of court and defamation. Usually accused persons also refer to the damage that can be caused to their reputation.
Mumbai serial blasts and film ‘Black Friday’
An accused in the 1993 Bombay serial blasts case, Mushtaq Moosa Tarani, had approached the Bombay High Court in 2005 seeking a stay on the release of Black Friday, a film based on the book by journalist S Hussain Zaidi. Initially based on an application filed before the trial court by 31 undertrial prisoners in the case, the words ‘True Story’ was removed from the title of the film.

Tarani submitted to the high court that he feared the film will vitiate a fair trial and have a damaging effect on the impartiality of the administration of justice and would amount to contempt of court. The HC restrained the film from being released till the final judgment in the case is pronounced. It said the loss to the petitioner’s dignity and reputation would be irreparable as the viewers may form an opinion about his guilt. It also said that the release of the film will have a prejudicial effect on the administration of justice and the image of the accused. The filmmakers had approached the Supreme Court against this order but the film was allowed to be released only after the judgment in the case in 2006.
Abu Salem and book My Name is Abu Salem
 Gangster Abu Salem had sought relief in deferring the book ‘My Name is Abu Salem’Gangster Abu Salem, who was facing trial for the murder of Mumbai-based builder Pradeep Jain, had also sought a similar relief deferring the release of a book titled, My Name is Abu Salem, as the trial in the case was ongoing in 2014. The special trial court had restrained the sale of the book directing it to be withdrawn from stores and e-portals after observing that the consent of the accused was not taken and that it may cause him prejudice. The Bombay High Court, however, had set aside the order stating that the trial court did not have powers to do so.
Batla House
 A still from the movie ‘Batla House’In another case before the Delhi High Court in 2019, the accused persons in the Batla House encounter case in Delhi sought that a film titled Batla House be postponed till the pending trials conclude. The court had ordered for a pre-screening of the film witnessed by counsel of both sides. Both parties agreed to resolve issues in the film, including deleting certain scenes showing the accused making explosive devices, their confessions and an actual photograph of a Delhi Police personnel. After this, the film was allowed to be released last year.

Justice Navin Chawla, after hearing the matter for over two hours, declined to grant relief to Choksi saying a writ petition for enforcement of a private right cannot be maintainable.
The court said his remedy lies in a civil suit and granted him the liberty to raise the issue in a civil suit.
Choksi, the promoter of Gitanjali Gems, and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank fraud case.
Choksi left the country last year and was granted citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda.
The documentary, Bad Boy Billionaires', which is scheduled to be released in India on September 2, is described on Netflix platform as, This investigative docuseries explores the greed, fraud and corruption that built up - and ultimately brought down - India's most infamous tycoons.

796047,1,2,"Ministers from 6 Oppn states move SC, seek review of court’s nod for NEET, JEE exams","‘Uttar Pradesh backs Centre’s decision to hold NEET, JEE’: CM Yogi Adityanath - Hindustan Times","Six ministers from Maharashtra, Punjab, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh moved the Supreme Court on Friday and sought review of its August 17 order allowing conduct of NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) entrance examinations.
The plea referred to the rise in Covid-19 cases in the country and said that if the August 17 order is not reviewed, grave and irreparable harm and injury would befall on the student community. The petitioners said not only will health, welfare and safety of students/candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE examinations stand imperilled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy…
The petitioners are Moloy Ghatak (minister from West Bengal), Rameshwar Oraon (Jharkhand), Raghu Sharma (Rajasthan), Amarjeet Bhagat (Chhattisgarh), Balbir Singh Sidhu (Punjab), and Uday Ravindra Samant (Maharashtra).
The petition, filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes, stated that the National Testing Agency (NTA) had notified that NEET (UG) will be held on September 13 and JEE (Mains) from September 1-6.
The plea said that as per NTA, approximately 9.53 lakh and 15.97 lakh students have registered for JEE (Mains) and NEET (UG), respectively. This means 25 lakh students cumulatively would be appearing for these two examinations, the petition stated. As on 27th August, India has over 3.31 million [more than 33 lakh] Covid-19 cases. We are presently at the third position in this unenviable list after the US (5.79 million cases) and Brazil (3.72 million) and on course to be the No. 1 nation on this list.
While there are 660 examination centres for JEE roughly 1,443 students per centre there are 3,843 centres for NEET, or approximately 415 students per centre, the petitioners pointed out. Such large movement of people will ipso facto prove to be a serious health hazard and will totally defeat the twin present-day solutions we have of combating the Covid-19 i.e. social distancing and avoidance of large public gatherings, they said, urging the court to postpone the entrance examinations.

The plea said, Having at least one centre per district would have minimised the inter-district travel of students and thereby reduced chances of Covid-19 spread.
The petitioners said, The mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or willingness or desire to attend physical exams, as no student would like to forego the exam, if its conducted and the respondents are forcing the students to put their lives and health in peril by conducting these exams.
In a situation, the plea said, where there is absolutely no classroom teaching, the decision of the Union Government to conduct examinations on such a massive scale reveals non-application of mind and is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious exercise of power.
The petitioners said they do not wish to make any value judgment or political criticism of the Union Government in such times but the undisputed facts are that there has been an exponential increase in both Covid-19 positive cases as well as deaths/mortality arising out of Covid-19 from April, when these exams were originally scheduled, till August, when the Union Government decided to conduct the said examinations.
The Covid-19 graph is showing a continuous upward movement and the ‘curve’ has not flattened for the Government to undertake such a massive exercise, the petition stated. It said that schools and colleges continue to remain shut despite the various phases of unlock and there is no rational nexus between the object of the examinations and the purpose that it seeks to achieve.

The six ministers stated that the Centre had adequate time to make comprehensive preparations for safe and successful conduct of the examinations. However, they argued, the intervening months from April to September were characterised by inaction, confusion, lethargy and inertia…now the Union Government has suddenly woken up to realise that their inertia is going to cost lakhs of students their academic year and therefore as a knee-jerk reaction…has haphazardly and hurriedly fixed the dates of the examinations.
The petitioners called it a remedy that will prove to be worse than the disease itself.
The plea said that postponing the exams by two months would give valuable time to the government to put in place an adequate mechanism in consultation with the State Governments, to ensure a smoother and safer conduct of examinations.
The petition also pointed to health issues of students and said that even otherwise, with recent evidences and information of the virus being allegedly airborne now, conducting of physical examination of such magnitude can have disastrous consequences.

The petition said there have been instances where surge in cases have been reported after offline exams were conducted.
The process of reaching the examination centre itself can be a major source of contracting the infection, and candidates may become vectors carrying the virus to their homes, it said.
The petitioners said, The mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or willingness or desire to attend physical exams, as no student would like to forego the exam, if its conducted and the respondents are forcing the students to put their lives and health in peril by conducting these exams.
They said, If the Union Govt/NTA decides to hold the exams, then the students do not have an effective choice left but to register and appear for the exam at great personal risk.
Oppn parties slam Centre: Listen to students
After approaching the Supreme Court, four Opposition parties led by the Congress on Friday hit out at the BJP-led central government, accusing it of being stubborn about holding the NEET and JEE examinations.
Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the government has been incompetent. He and Congress president Sonia Gandhi asked the government to listen to students.
Please, listen to them. Have a conversation and resolve this issue peacefully, he said.
Addressing a joint press conference, Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren (JMM), Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O Brien and Maharashtra Higher Education Minister Uday Samant (Shiv Sena) slammed the Centre over the issue.

The chief minister also said all activities should be carried out while following the Covid-19 protocol, adding that the B.Ed (Bachelor of Education) entrance examination was conducted for five lakh candidates in the state on August 9 and there were no complaints about the Covid-19 infection during that exam.
The Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) should also conduct its examinations in a similar manner, he said. Adityanath was reviewing the Unlock-3 situation at a high-level meeting at his official residence in Lucknow on Friday.

The National Testing Authority (NTA), the nodal body to conduct examinations, and the central government plan to hold JEE-Main between September 1 and 6 and NEET on September 13. JEE-Main and NEET are for undergraduate engineering and medical aspirants, respectively.
A review petition was filed before the Supreme Court on Friday by ministers from six non-BJP-ruled states challenging an August 17 order of the Supreme Court which had allowed the central government to hold NEET and JEE in September despite the prevailing Covid-19 situation.
These six states are West Bengal, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Maharashtra.
Yogi Adityanath reiterated his directive for 1.50 lakh Covid-19 tests per day in the state.
All efforts should continue to break the chain of Covid-19, he said, adding that there should be an increase in medical testing with a special increase in the number of rapid antigen tests per day. The number of RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests per day should also go up and there should be an increase in the required manpower for the purpose, the chief minister directed officials.
He also said district magistrates should focus on pandemic work between 9 am to 10 am, inspect offices between 10 am and 11 am and redress grievances of people in their offices between 11 am and 1 pm.
The chief minister also asked additional chief secretaries/principal secretaries to carry out inspection of offices functioning under them. He said barring the employees on leave or those who were sick, 50 percent of attendance should be ensured in all the offices and action should be taken against those found absent at 9.30 am. Adityanath also said an inspection system should be implemented at the tehsil and development block levels. The same system should be followed by the police officers as well, he added.
“In the absence of district magistrates and subdivisional magistrates, any other responsible officer should follow the schedule at various levels,” he said.
Besides improving surveillance, the arrangements at the integrated command and control centres should be increased. People should be made aware of Covid-19 in such a manner that they did not feel afraid to come forward for treatment, he said.
Work on the paediatric institute coming up in Gorakhpur should be completed in time, he said. The chief minister noted that cases of malaria had been reported from some districts. He said special medical teams should be sent and necessary arrangements for medical treatment should be made available there.
Arrangements for the distribution of fertilisers should be smooth and monitored regularly, he said. He also directed officials to take action against sugar mills owners who are not clearing the dues of cane growers.
The distribution of relief and compensation to people in the flood-affected areas should be timely ensured, he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/ministers-from-6-oppn-states-move-sc-seek-review-of-courts-nod-for-neet-jee-exams-6574240/,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-backs-centre-s-decision-to-hold-neet-jee-cm-yogi-adityanath/story-9b0aQtItaOvwLf5hPK8dLN.html
5097756,1,2,"6 non-BJP states file review petition in Supreme Court for NEET, JEE postponement - Hindustan Times",6 ministers of Oppn-ruled states move SC seeking review of NEET-JEE order,"A review petition was filed before the Supreme Court on Friday by ministers from six non-BJP-ruled states challenging an August 17 order of Supreme Court which had allowed the central government to hold the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE) in September despite the prevailing Covid -19 situation.
The review petitioners stated that the Supreme Court, in its August 17 order, failed to consider the safety and security of students who are slated to appear for NEET and JEE and also failed to take into account the logistical difficulties in conducting the examinations. 
“If the order of August 17, 2020 is not reviewed, then grave and irreparable harm and injury will befall the student community of our country and not only will health, welfare and safety of students appearing for NEET/ JEE stand imperilled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy in these Covid -19 pandemic times,” the petition filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes said. 
The six ministers who have filed the petition are Moloy Ghatak (West Bengal), Dr. Rameshwar Oraon (Jharkhand), Dr. Raghu Sharma (Rajasthan), Amarjeet Bhagat (Chhattisgarh), Balbir Singh Sidhu (Punjab) and Uday Ravindra Samant (Maharashtra).
NEET for students seeking admission to medical and dental courses is scheduled to be held on September 13 and the JEE for those aspiring to join top engineering schools is scheduled to be conducted from September 1 to 6.
A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra had, on August 17, rejected a plea filed in August by 11 NEET/ JEE candidates seeking postponement of the exams until after the Covid-19 crisis has passed.
Justice Mishra, while hearing that case on August 17, had said “life has to go on” despite the outbreak of the viral disease and the court cannot put the career of students in jeopardy by interfering with the decision of the National Testing Agency (NTA) to hold the examinations in September.
“Life has to move on even in Covid times. Covid may continue but postponement of exams is a loss for the country. Are you (petitioners) ready to waste a whole year,” justice Mishra had said.
On July 3, the NTA, the central government body tasked with conducting JEE and NEET, came out with public notices to hold the exams in September.
“The career of students cannot be put in peril. We find no merit in the petition. The petition is dismissed,” the bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, had ordered on August 17.
The review petition filed on Friday stated that the Supreme Court’s order of August 17 failed to consider that the decision to conduct examinations amid the ongoing pandemic increases the vulnerability of the students and their families to the risk of infection.
It was further submitted that the Centre had adequate time to make preparations for safe and successful conduct of the examinations but the intervening months from April to September were characterized by inaction and lethargy.
“Now the Union government has suddenly woken up to realise that their inertia is going to cost lakhs of students their academic year and therefore as a knee jerk reaction, the Union government has haphazardly and hurriedly fixed the dates of examinations,” the petition said. 
Further, the petition also said that students from rural areas and semi-urban areas might be forced to use unsafe modes of transportation to reach examination centres and would thereby expose themselves and everyone else to Covid -19.
Besides, students residing in distant placed will find it it difficult to reach examination centres due to limited availability of transportation services during Covid -19.
“Students in tribal pockets and remote areas will face an unfair hurdle to reach and stay at the examination centres compared to those already residing in urban areas or in the vicinity of exam centres,” the plea said.","Six ministers of opposition ruled states -- West Bengal, Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand -- have jointly filed a review petition in the Supreme Court challenging its August 17 order declining to entertain pleas seeking postponement of NEET-JEE exams slated in September in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic.
The petition has been filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes and it contends the top court's order to ""secure the safety, security and right to life of the students -- candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE exams.""
The petition argues that the top court has ignored the teething logistical difficulties in conducting the examinations at the proposed dates.
""Failed to balance the competing but equally important aspects of conducting the examination and securing safety of the student. Fails to ensure that mandatory safeguards are put in place during the conducting of the examinations,"" said the petition challenging the August 17 order.
""The advice of 'Life Must Go On' may have sounded very philosophical underpinnings but cannot be a substitute for valid legal reasoning and logical analysis of the various aspects involved in the conduct of the NEET (UG) and JEE exams,"" argued the petitioners.
The petitioners said the apex court failed to appreciate that the Centre had adequate time to establish at least one centre for every district for NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) rather than having several centres in one district.
""Having at least one centre per district would have minimised the inter-district long travel of the students and thereby reduced the chances of Covid-19 spread,"" argued the petitioners.
The petitioners contended that if the August 17 order is not reviewed then grave and irreparable harm and injury would befall on the student community of the country and it will impact health, welfare and safety of the students/candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE examinations.
""With regards to the second reason of losing a year, it is most respectfully submitted that this would be tantamount to putting the cart before the horse, as the submissions hereinabove have revealed.
""The Review Petitioners too do not desire for the students to lose an academic year, but wish to balance their health, safety and security and that of their family with not losing the current academic year,"" said the petition.
The Petitioner number one is Moloy Ghatak -- Minister-in-Charge, Department of Labour &amp; E.S.I. (MB) Scheme and Departments of Law &amp; Judicial, Government of West Bengal.
Petitioner number two is Dr. Rameshwar Oraon -- Cabinet Minister of Finance, Government of Jharkhand.
Petitioner number three is Dr. Raghu Sharma -- Cabinet Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Rajasthan.

While one video showed her father being mobbed by the media, the second one was of her building watchman being surrounded by mediapersons.
Later, after ED officers, too, sought the help of the Mumbai Police, two policemen went to the Chakraborty residence and escorted Indraneel to the Santacruz police station. From there, ED officers escorted him to a bank in Vakola in connection with its probe.
Meanwhile, at the DRDO guesthouse, the CBI questioned Showik Chakraborty about his relations with Sushant and the last time he had interacted with him, an officer said. The agency also questioned the actors friend and flatmate Siddharth Pithani and cook Neeraj among others. It is likely to summon Rhea for questioning later this week.
Three separate FIRs have been registered by CBI, ED and Narcotics Control Bureau in connection with Sushants death. A three-member NCB team from Delhi arrived in Mumbai on Thursday to probe the drugs aspect in the actor death case. On Tuesday, the ED had informed NCB in a letter that its investigation had revealed that drugs were supplied to Rhea and Sushant. Following this, NCB had registered an FIR against Rhea and others.
A Mumbai Police officer said that currently, there is no progress in their inquiry into the accidental death report lodged following Sushants death.
The actor was found dead on June 14 at his Bandra residence. His father, K K Singh, on Thursday released a video in which he said, Rhea Chakraborty was giving poison to my son, Sushant, for a long time. She is his murderer. The investigating agency must arrest her and her associates.","NEW DELHI: In a fresh development in the Sushant Singh Rajput's death probe, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has summoned the late actor's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty to appear before it today. 
According to a report in 
Times Now, the 28-year-old was issued summons on Friday morning and is expected to be questioned in the day. The CBI SIT (Special Investigation Team), lead by an SP-rank officer, Mukul Prasad, will quiz and examine her. The interrogation is likely to be a long one, and could take place today,

The central intelligence agency is likely to quiz Chakraborty on matters related to Rajput's finances, his health and the alleged drug use. 
The CBI is currently examining the statement of her brother Showik Chakraborty after he was grilled by the agency for over 14 hours at the DRDO guest house in Mumbai on Thursday. 
Earlier on Thursday, Chakraborty had claimed that her life was under threat and had asked the Mumbai Police for protection. On the same day, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) became the third central agency to join the probe into the late actor's death to investigate her alleged links to banned drugs.
So far, the ED (Enforcement Directorate) has grilled the 'Jalebi' actress twice, following an FIR registered by Rajput's father KK Singh at the Patna police station on July 25.

7237513,1,2,Joe Biden's victory will endanger nation and destroy American greatness: Donald Trump,"Republicans rally behind Trump, say Biden no longer has any principles","Washington: Seeking another four years in the White House, US President Donald Trump has slammed Democratic rival Joe Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness. 
Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration. 
Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: ""Joe Biden is not the saviour of America's soul."" 
""He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness."" 
""Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history,"" Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate. 
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election. 
""Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs,"" Trump alleged. 
During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). 
Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered. 
""This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,"" he said. 
""This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades,"" he said. 
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens. 
""And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it,"" he said. 
Referring to the last week's Democrat National Convention, Trump said that Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. 
""So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?"" he asked. 
""In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history,"" he said. 
Trump alleged that for 47 years, Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain - and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands. 
""Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars,"" he alleged. 
""Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defence,"" he said. 
Trump alleged that as vice president Biden supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. 
""He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing (Qasem) Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as ""a positive development"" for America and the world. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win,"" he said. 
""China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused,"" Trump said. 
He called Biden a Trojan horse for socialism. 
""Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden's America,"" he said, referring to violent protests there. 
On November 3, he urged his countrymen to send the Democrats led by Biden a thundering message they will never forget! ""Joe Biden is weak"". 
""He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.","Top Republican party leaders Thursday night rallied behind President Donald Trump as they used the platform of Republican National Convention to launch a blistering attack on his Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden.
""The Democrats are urging you to vote for an obviously defective candidate. Biden has changed his principles so often, he no longer has any principles, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said in his address to the Republican National Convention before Trump delivered his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House.
""He's a Trojan Horse with Bernie (Sanders), AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), (Nancy) Pelosi, Black Lives Matter and his party's entire Left Wing hidden inside his body just waiting to execute their pro-criminal, anti-police policies, said the former New York City Mayor.
The whole unprecedented wave of lawlessness began with a truly just cause -- the unforgiveable police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Peaceful protests began all over the land. The condemnation of the killing was universal from President Trump to Democrat leaders, he said.
It seemed for a a few brief shining moments' like Democrat and Republican leaders would come together with a unified proposal to reduce police misconduct. This possibility was very dangerous to the Left, Giuliani said.
Biden and his fellow Democrats were widely criticized for not speaking up about the out-of-control violence plaguing Democrat cities in our country. Their silence was so deafening that it reveals an acceptance of this violence because they will accept anything they hope will defeat President Donald Trump, he said.
However, they are making this election a choice between the Democrat policies soft on crime against the Republican program of law and order. It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city, town or suburb, Giuliani said.
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said Joe Biden and Kamala Harris think this election is about the government. They're wrong. It's about you, not us. Your family and your future, he said.
Congressman Jeff Van Drew said that Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running the Democratic Party. the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president, he said.
Debbie Flood, the owner of a Wisconsin machine shop, alleged that Biden voted to normalize trade with China and helped pave the way for them to join the WTO, even though they were hurting American companies like hers.
Our President understands that the best solutions unleash the innovation of American entrepreneurs and the creativity of American workers. Joe Biden doesn't know anything about business. Or about creating jobs, she said.
He's spent 47 years in government. It is doubtful that he'll finally figure it out in year 48. He's pledged to raise our taxes and bring back excessive regulation, Flood said.
US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson said that Trump is the most pro-life President in our country's history. He will continue to fight for those who cannot yet speak, he said.
Our President, Donald J. Trump, believes in the people. He is one of us. He makes promises, and he keeps them. He is transparent, and we certainly know what he's thinking. He does not submit to political correctness or to its enforcers, the media. He is real, Carson said.
Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch said, ""You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America. You can have four more years of President Trump.""
Joe Biden won't stand up for America. Donald Trump will. So this November, let's stand with the president and vote to keep America great, Giuliani said.

1254159,1,2,"Sadak 2 movie review: One of 2020’s worst films, take this trip at your own risk - Hindustan Times",Movie Review: Sadak 2 - 2/5,"Sadak 2 movie review
Cast: Alia Bhatt, Sanjay Dutt, Aditya Roy Kapur, Pooja Bhatt, Makrand Deshpande
Director: Mahesh Bhatt
Sanjay Dutt is in on it, and perhaps he is the only one. As Sadak 2 meanders between fake babas and greedy families, as it slaps on the melodrama and the rest of the cast goes through the paces, Sanjay Dutt really gets into the spirit of things. His Ravi is grizzled and shows his gut, but that doesn’t stop him from going head-to-head with the first baddie he sees. Don’t miss the smile on his face and the song on his lips as he goes at it. He brings the only moments of joy in this uniformly dreary outing.
 Watch Sadak 2 trailer
The trouble with Sadak 2 is that it is so deeply entrenched in the worst aspects of 90s filmmaking that all of Dutt’s aching intensity and hell-for-leather action cannot free it. It’s a far cry from the superb cinema Mahesh Bhatt served us back in the day – I speak of Naam and Zakhm, Arth and Daddy. Sadak 2 regurgitates the most cliched, exaggerated pulp that Bollywood spewed out in the decade, and in the one preceding it.
The themes of death, suicide and mental illness are all pervasive in the film and are handled with all the finesse of a bull in a china shop. Aching for his lost love, Sanjay’s Ravi constantly talks of a ‘reunion up in the heavens’ and often tries to act on it. The one time his friend manages to drag him to the hospital, the doctor asks him what he would do if his house was on fire. His answer involves a can of petrol. Alia Bhatt’s Aarya, who is trying to unmask a ‘dhongi baba’ named Gyaan Prakash (Makrand Deshpande), is quickly labelled crazy and sent to the same doc. There is even a mention of her being threatened with electric shock therapy!
Written by Mahesh Bhatt and Suhrita Sengupta, the film looks dated from the word go. Makrand Deshpande’s cut-out hulks over a religious ceremony that is straight out of a Dan Brown book. This is perhaps the only time we really see anything remotely connected to religion or faith. Alia spray-paints the word ‘revenge’ on the cut-out before setting it afire. Amid this private Dussehra, she is chased around by the baba’s minions and ends up in the said hospital. 
An heiress, Alia goes on the run from the fake baba – an ungainly phrase, doesn’t help how many times the film says it -- who has got his hooks into her family too – father Yogesh (Jisshu Sengupta) and step mommy Nandini (Priyanka Bose). She hires Ravi, who is pining for his lost love (Pooja Bhatt, seen only in portraits), to drive her to Kailash to fulfil a promise she made to her dead mother. Coming along for the ride is her boyfriend (Aditya Roy Kapur). What follows are more twists than you’d see even in an Abbas-Mustan film, and each is more hilarious than the last one, finally leading us to one of the most cringe-inducing climaxes of any film this year.
Many veterans put in an appearance too – there is Gulshan Grover as Dilip Hathkata and Mohan Joshi as a corrupt police officer Rajesh. Weighed down by the ponderous story and sluggish pace, none of them add much to Sadak 2. Even the naturally gifted Alia Bhatt fails to rise above the expository dialogues and the leaden narrative. 
Montages from the original Sadak, interspersed through this iteration, never let us forget how half baked this product is. And then there are the self-referential nods – Makrand’s baba appears in drag, as a nod to Sadashiv Amrapurkar’s iconic Maharani from the first film, perhaps. It comes across as a cheap knock-off, a lot like this film.","STORY: After her mother Shakuntala Desais death under mysterious circumstances, the Desai Group of Industries scion Aarya (Alia Bhatt) vows to avenge the murder and bring the culprits to justice. And, in order to honour her mothers last wish, Aarya embarks on a journey to Kailash and the story of Sadak 2 unfolds.REVIEW: Her entire family comprising the maasi-turned-step-mother Nandini Maa (Priyanka Bose) and father Yogesh (Jisshu Sengupta) is under the spell of dhongi sadhu Gyaan Prakash (Makarand Deshpande) but Aarya, all of 20, knows better. Utterly convinced that her beloved mother died owing to an elaborate plan hatched by Gyaan Prakash and that disease Nandini, Aarya launches an online campaign called India Fights Fake Gurus. Her motivation is to reveal the truth behind these supposed messengers of God and debunk the myth and mystery surrounding them. While treading along this mission, Aarya falls in love with a former troll a very good-looking musician with issues of his own, Vishal (Aditya Roy Kapur). Together, they embark on a pilgrimage to fulfil Aaryas maa-ka-aakhri-sapna of visiting Kailash on her 21st birthday.
However, there is a small hurdle the booking agent/ co-owner of Pooja Travels and Tours (that guarantees safety and security 24*7) is now dead and her taxi driver husband Ravis (Sanjay Dutt) only purpose in life is to reunite with her in Heaven. After much cajoling and persuasion, the heartbroken cabbie reluctantly says yes. Soon after, they find solace in each other and a unique friendship blossoms that is a win-win for both Aarya derives strength and hope from the lonely man and Ravi seeks a new purpose in life through this young girl driven to achieve what she is set out to do.
Back in the 90s, when Sadak, starring Sanjay Dutt and Pooja Bhatt, hit the theatres, it was such a rage among the audience; for two reasons: the incredible love ballads and its engaging plotline. 20 years on, Mahesh Bhatt conjures up a script to take that story on the road again. 
Sadak 2 starts off with a grim, almost melancholic setting, where the hopeless protagonist Ravi is tying a rope around his neck and talking to his deceased wife Pooja about their impending reunion in the afterlife. But the fan that he is hanging on to comes crashing down, and Ravi has to live another day. While listening to Hum Tere Bin Kahin Reh Nahin Paate (such nostalgia, much wow!) in his garage and planning yet another exit, his door bolts open and a hyper Aarya storms in demanding her three-month advance booking be honoured. Thus, begins a journey of random twists-and-turns, both on the road and off it, and a screenplay that goes down various routes and eventually hits a dead-end.
We dont know where to begin with: the dialogues are dated and over the top. Its been decades since we heard anyone in the movies say Jo garjte hai woh baraste nahi or Aadmi karz lauta sakta hain, ehsaan nahin. No matter what the logic is, co-writers Pushpdeep Bhardwaj, Mahesh Bhatt and Suhrita Sengupta could have done much better with the writing that is so passé. Now shifting focus to the set design and overall look-and-feel of the movie: the gundas wear flashy and eye-popping outfits, big wigs and enact dramatic knife-wielding scenes on camera topped with caricaturish action sequences. The background score by Sandeep Chowta deserves a special mention here and not for the right reasons its melodramatic and borderline annoying. 
Alia Bhatt, who is known for her fine performances on screen, falls flat this one time. Apart from a few emotional scenes, this act - by her own high standards - is strictly average. Aditya Roy Kapur doesnt have much role to play besides looking smoking hot and after a point, he appears aloof and even takes a back seat. Sanjay Dutt pulls off his emotional scenes quite well with those welled-up bulgy eyes doing all the talking. Even at this age, he sure knows how to bring off an action sequence taking down the baddies one by one. In a smaller role, Jisshu Sengupta as Alias daddy is impactful and he totally owns the few frames that he has in this action-drama. On the other hand, seasoned actors like Makarand Deshpande and Priyanka Bose deliver some unbelievably overblown acting. Their pseudo holy/ satanic act is hilarious to the core and quite frankly, at times we wonder whether to laugh or cry even during the emotionally-charged scenes. 
It is rather disappointing to see a filmmaker of Mahesh Bhatts stature to make a comeback as a director with Sadak 2. No offense but why this, Bhatt saab?
In a nutshell, Sadak 2, for everyone involved with this project, should have been a road not taken. And for those who are planning on watching this purely for sentimental reasons, be forewarned: This Sadak leads nowhere; turn back.

5983453,1,2,"Amazon orders 1,800 Mercedes-Benz electric vans for European deliveries - Reuters","Amazon Buys 1,800 Electric Mercedes Vans in Latest Green Effort - Bloomberg","(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said on Friday it had ordered 1,800 electric vans from Mercedes-Benz for its European delivery fleet, as part of the online retailer’s plans to run a carbon neutral business by 2040. 
A majority of the electric vehicles from Daimler AG’s (DAIGn.DE) car and vans division will go into service this year, the company said, adding that it had ordered 1,200 of Mercedes-Benz’s larger eSprinter models and 600 of the midsize eVitos. 
The order is the largest for Mercedes-Benz’s electric vehicles to date and includes 800 vans for Germany and 500 for the United Kingdom. 
It is dwarfed, however, by Amazon’s recent order for 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian Automotive LLC, a startup it has invested in. 
Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a statement the Daimler agreement was part of the retailer’s “journey to build the most sustainable transportation fleet in the world.” 
Mercedes-Benz on Friday joined The Climate Pledge, started by Amazon last year, which calls on signatories to be net zero carbon across their businesses by 2040. The automaker has previously said it was aiming to have a carbon neutral fleet by 2039. 
In 2018, Amazon became the biggest customer of Mercedes’ non-electric Sprinter vans, securing 20,000 vehicles for delivery contractors. 
“Moving forward, we are prioritizing the addition of electric vehicles,” Ross Rachey, Amazon’s director of global fleet and products for last-mile delivery told Reuters. 
Other delivery companies are pushing for more electric fleets. In January United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said it was ordering 10,000 delivery trucks from UK-based Arrival Ltd. 
Daimler’s rivals are also working on bringing electric vans to market. Ford Motor Co (F.N) plans an all-electric version of its Transit van in North America in 2022, and General Motors Co (GM.N) aims to start production of an electric van in late 2021. 
Reporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Tom Brown","Amazon.com Inc. is buying 1,800 electric delivery vans from Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, the retailer’s biggest commitment to date to cut the carbon footprint of its delivery operations in Europe.
The deal, for the German automaker’s eSprinter and eVito models, will be complete by the end of the year, Amazon said in a statement on Friday. It comes two years after Amazon agreed to buy 
20,000 conventionally fueled Mercedes Sprinter vans to help build its package delivery operations in the U.S.
Explore dynamic updates of the earth’s key data points
Amazon, which is increasingly delivering shipments with its own staff or contractors instead of relying on major carriers, last year announced a deal to buy 100,000 
custom-built electric vans made by Rivian Automotive Inc. The electric truck startup expects to start production next year and complete the order by 2030. The Mercedes purchase makes it clear Amazon will also seek vehicles from other automakers to remove planet-warming greenhouse gases from its delivery fleet.
Electric vehicles are a major piece of 
Amazon’s effort to become a net zero emitter of carbon by 2040, an ambitious goal for a company that historically 
had lagged behind its retail and technology peers on the environment. As part of that initiative, Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos in September announced the Climate Pledge, an open invitation for other companies to match Amazon’s commitment and track and report their own emissions.
As part of Friday’s announcement, Mercedes became the fourth signatory to the pledge, joining three 
initial signers from earlier this year.
It’s unclear whether Mercedes, which had previously announced plans to make its passenger fleet carbon neutral by 
2039, has agreed to any new environmental commitments as part of its participation in Amazon’s climate pact. Daimler has been reporting its carbon emissions to the public and global tracking organizations since at least 2010, according to data from CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project. Amazon disclosed its carbon footprint for the first time last year but hasn’t submitted data to CDP’s closely watched public tracker.
An Amazon spokesman said the Climate Pledge commitment was made by the Mercedes subsidiary, not Daimler as a whole, which also owns brands like American truck manufacturers Freightliner and Western Star. A Daimler spokesman said that by having the unit sign the Climate Pledge, the company is reinforcing its commitments and is “excited to join a community that will share knowledge, ideas and best practices.”

The Congress and other opposition parties have raised their voices against the entrance exams, held for admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and medical colleges across the country, in September. Ministers from six non-BJP-ruled states have filed a review petition before the Supreme Court challenging its August 17 order which had allowed the central government to hold NEET and JEE in September despite the prevailing Covid -19 situation.
“My dear students, I feel for you because you are now facing a very difficult situation. The issue of your exams, of when they should be taken up and where, is the most important issue not only for you but your family too,” Gandhi said in a video message.

“You are our future. We depend on you to build a better India. Therefore, if any decision has to be taken regarding your future, it is important that it is being taken with your concurrence. I hope the government listens to you, listens to your voices and act upon your wishes. This is my advice to the government. Thank you. Jai Hind,” Gandhi said in the message tweeted by her party.
She had held a meeting with the chief ministers of seven states earlier this week over the issue during which West Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee and Punjab’s Amarinder Singh called for moving the Supreme Court.
The ministry of education has said JEE Main and NEET-UG will be conducted in September as scheduled amid a growing chorus for postponing the crucial tests in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. JEE Main is scheduled from September 1-6 and NEET is planned on September 13. Around 8.58 lakh candidates have registered for JEE-Main and 15.97 lakh have registered for NEET.
Before Sonia Gandhi’s message, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urged people to raise their voice against the Centre’s decision to hold the exams next month.
“Unite your voice with lakhs of suffering students. #SpeakUpForStudentSafety from 10am onwards. Let’s make the Govt listen to the students,” Gandhi tweeted in the morning.
The government, on its part, has said that more than 1.7 million candidates have already downloaded their admit cards for JEE and NEET, which shows students want the exams to be conducted.
“National Testing Agency (NTA) officials told me that over seven lakh candidates have downloaded the JEE-Main admit cards while over 10 lakh aspirants have downloaded the NEET admit cards. This shows that the students want the exams to be held at any cost,” Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal “Nishank” said on Thursday.
“We have received mails from students and parents who are in favour of holding the exams, as they have been preparing for the exams for at least two to three years. The Supreme Court too opined that a full academic year cannot be wasted. After two deferments, the exam dates have been finalised,” he added.
The Supreme Court last week dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the two exams amid a spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country, saying a “precious” academic year of students “cannot be wasted” and that life has to go on.
NTA has said it will increase the number of examination centres, put in an alternative seating plan with fewer candidates per room and staggered entry and exit for safely conducting NEET and JEE in September.
The exams have been deferred twice in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The JEE-Mains was originally scheduled to be held from April 7 to April 11 but was postponed to July 18-23. The NEET-UG was originally scheduled for May 3 but was pushed to July 26.","NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday launched a

(Express photo by Partha Paul)Six ministers from Maharashtra, Punjab, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh moved the Supreme Court on Friday and sought review of its August 17 order allowing conduct of NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) entrance examinations.
The plea referred to the rise in Covid-19 cases in the country and said that if the August 17 order is not reviewed, grave and irreparable harm and injury would befall on the student community. The petitioners said not only will health, welfare and safety of students/candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE examinations stand imperilled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy…
The petitioners are Moloy Ghatak (minister from West Bengal), Rameshwar Oraon (Jharkhand), Raghu Sharma (Rajasthan), Amarjeet Bhagat (Chhattisgarh), Balbir Singh Sidhu (Punjab), and Uday Ravindra Samant (Maharashtra).
The petition, filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes, stated that the National Testing Agency (NTA) had notified that NEET (UG) will be held on September 13 and JEE (Mains) from September 1-6.
The plea said that as per NTA, approximately 9.53 lakh and 15.97 lakh students have registered for JEE (Mains) and NEET (UG), respectively. This means 25 lakh students cumulatively would be appearing for these two examinations, the petition stated. As on 27th August, India has over 3.31 million [more than 33 lakh] Covid-19 cases. We are presently at the third position in this unenviable list after the US (5.79 million cases) and Brazil (3.72 million) and on course to be the No. 1 nation on this list.
While there are 660 examination centres for JEE roughly 1,443 students per centre there are 3,843 centres for NEET, or approximately 415 students per centre, the petitioners pointed out. Such large movement of people will ipso facto prove to be a serious health hazard and will totally defeat the twin present-day solutions we have of combating the Covid-19 i.e. social distancing and avoidance of large public gatherings, they said, urging the court to postpone the entrance examinations.

The plea said, Having at least one centre per district would have minimised the inter-district travel of students and thereby reduced chances of Covid-19 spread.
The petitioners said, The mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or willingness or desire to attend physical exams, as no student would like to forego the exam, if its conducted and the respondents are forcing the students to put their lives and health in peril by conducting these exams.
In a situation, the plea said, where there is absolutely no classroom teaching, the decision of the Union Government to conduct examinations on such a massive scale reveals non-application of mind and is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious exercise of power.
The petitioners said they do not wish to make any value judgment or political criticism of the Union Government in such times but the undisputed facts are that there has been an exponential increase in both Covid-19 positive cases as well as deaths/mortality arising out of Covid-19 from April, when these exams were originally scheduled, till August, when the Union Government decided to conduct the said examinations.
The Covid-19 graph is showing a continuous upward movement and the ‘curve’ has not flattened for the Government to undertake such a massive exercise, the petition stated. It said that schools and colleges continue to remain shut despite the various phases of unlock and there is no rational nexus between the object of the examinations and the purpose that it seeks to achieve.

The six ministers stated that the Centre had adequate time to make comprehensive preparations for safe and successful conduct of the examinations. However, they argued, the intervening months from April to September were characterised by inaction, confusion, lethargy and inertia…now the Union Government has suddenly woken up to realise that their inertia is going to cost lakhs of students their academic year and therefore as a knee-jerk reaction…has haphazardly and hurriedly fixed the dates of the examinations.
The petitioners called it a remedy that will prove to be worse than the disease itself.
The plea said that postponing the exams by two months would give valuable time to the government to put in place an adequate mechanism in consultation with the State Governments, to ensure a smoother and safer conduct of examinations.
The petition also pointed to health issues of students and said that even otherwise, with recent evidences and information of the virus being allegedly airborne now, conducting of physical examination of such magnitude can have disastrous consequences.

The petition said there have been instances where surge in cases have been reported after offline exams were conducted.
The process of reaching the examination centre itself can be a major source of contracting the infection, and candidates may become vectors carrying the virus to their homes, it said.
The petitioners said, The mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or willingness or desire to attend physical exams, as no student would like to forego the exam, if its conducted and the respondents are forcing the students to put their lives and health in peril by conducting these exams.
They said, If the Union Govt/NTA decides to hold the exams, then the students do not have an effective choice left but to register and appear for the exam at great personal risk.
Oppn parties slam Centre: Listen to students
After approaching the Supreme Court, four Opposition parties led by the Congress on Friday hit out at the BJP-led central government, accusing it of being stubborn about holding the NEET and JEE examinations.
Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the government has been incompetent. He and Congress president Sonia Gandhi asked the government to listen to students.
Please, listen to them. Have a conversation and resolve this issue peacefully, he said.
Addressing a joint press conference, Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren (JMM), Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O Brien and Maharashtra Higher Education Minister Uday Samant (Shiv Sena) slammed the Centre over the issue.

For all the latest Education News, download Indian Express App.","A review petition was filed before the Supreme Court on Friday by ministers from six non-BJP-ruled states challenging an August 17 order of Supreme Court which had allowed the central government to hold the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE) in September despite the prevailing Covid -19 situation.
The review petitioners stated that the Supreme Court, in its August 17 order, failed to consider the safety and security of students who are slated to appear for NEET and JEE and also failed to take into account the logistical difficulties in conducting the examinations. 
“If the order of August 17, 2020 is not reviewed, then grave and irreparable harm and injury will befall the student community of our country and not only will health, welfare and safety of students appearing for NEET/ JEE stand imperilled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy in these Covid -19 pandemic times,” the petition filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes said. 
The six ministers who have filed the petition are Moloy Ghatak (West Bengal), Dr. Rameshwar Oraon (Jharkhand), Dr. Raghu Sharma (Rajasthan), Amarjeet Bhagat (Chhattisgarh), Balbir Singh Sidhu (Punjab) and Uday Ravindra Samant (Maharashtra).
NEET for students seeking admission to medical and dental courses is scheduled to be held on September 13 and the JEE for those aspiring to join top engineering schools is scheduled to be conducted from September 1 to 6.
A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra had, on August 17, rejected a plea filed in August by 11 NEET/ JEE candidates seeking postponement of the exams until after the Covid-19 crisis has passed.
Justice Mishra, while hearing that case on August 17, had said “life has to go on” despite the outbreak of the viral disease and the court cannot put the career of students in jeopardy by interfering with the decision of the National Testing Agency (NTA) to hold the examinations in September.
“Life has to move on even in Covid times. Covid may continue but postponement of exams is a loss for the country. Are you (petitioners) ready to waste a whole year,” justice Mishra had said.
On July 3, the NTA, the central government body tasked with conducting JEE and NEET, came out with public notices to hold the exams in September.
“The career of students cannot be put in peril. We find no merit in the petition. The petition is dismissed,” the bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, had ordered on August 17.
The review petition filed on Friday stated that the Supreme Court’s order of August 17 failed to consider that the decision to conduct examinations amid the ongoing pandemic increases the vulnerability of the students and their families to the risk of infection.
It was further submitted that the Centre had adequate time to make preparations for safe and successful conduct of the examinations but the intervening months from April to September were characterized by inaction and lethargy.
“Now the Union government has suddenly woken up to realise that their inertia is going to cost lakhs of students their academic year and therefore as a knee jerk reaction, the Union government has haphazardly and hurriedly fixed the dates of examinations,” the petition said. 
Further, the petition also said that students from rural areas and semi-urban areas might be forced to use unsafe modes of transportation to reach examination centres and would thereby expose themselves and everyone else to Covid -19.
Besides, students residing in distant placed will find it it difficult to reach examination centres due to limited availability of transportation services during Covid -19.
“Students in tribal pockets and remote areas will face an unfair hurdle to reach and stay at the examination centres compared to those already residing in urban areas or in the vicinity of exam centres,” the plea said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/ministers-from-6-oppn-states-move-sc-seek-review-of-courts-nod-for-neet-jee-exams-6574240/,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-ministers-from-non-bjp-states-file-review-petition-in-supreme-court-for-postponement-of-neet-jee/story-9zNsgnsf3SQ5cVRAV6USOJ.html
4496653,1,2,Over 400 million poor now have access to banks due to Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana: Finance minis... - Hindustan Times,Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana completes 6 years today here's a look at its journey – CNBCTV18,"The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), the country’s financial inclusion initiative that was launched six years ago, has more than 403.5 million accounts with total deposits in excess of Rs 1.30 lakh crore, the Union finance ministry said.
The scheme, which has become the basis of direct transfer of cash subsidy to the poor, was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech on August 15, 2014, and was launched on August 28 that year.
“Today, six years ago, the PMJDY was launched with an ambitious aim of banking the unbanked. This initiative has been a game-changer, serving as the foundation for several poverty alleviation initiatives, benefitting crores of people,” PM Modi tweeted on Friday.
The government is planning to expand the scheme to provide insurance coverage to PMJDY account holders. “Eligible PMJDY account holders will be sought to be covered under PMJJBY [Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana] and PMSBY [Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana]. Banks have already been communicated about the same,” it said in a statement.
The government is also planning to promote digital payments, including RuPay debit card usage, among PMJDY account holders through creation of acceptance infrastructure across the country and provide access of the account holders to micro-credit and micro investment facilities, it added. 
According to the statement, as on August 19, out of the total PMJDY account holders, 63.6% were in rural areas and 55.2% accounts belonged to women. “Thanks to the PMJDY, the future of several families has become secure. A high proportion of beneficiaries are from rural areas and are women,” the PM said in another tweet.
Financial inclusion is a national priority of the government, as it is an enabler for inclusive growth, the finance ministry said. “It is important as it provides an avenue to the poor for bringing their savings into the formal financial system, an avenue to remit money to their families in villages besides taking them out of the clutches of the usurious money lenders,” it added.
“The PMJDY has been the foundation stone for the Modi government’s people-centric economic initiatives. Whether it is direct benefit transfers (DBTs), coronavirus disease (Covid-19) financial assistance, PM-KISAN, increased wages under the MGNREGA [Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005], life and health insurance cover, the first step was to provide every adult with a bank account, which PMJDY has nearly completed,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.
The PMJDY became an important instrument to expeditiously provide relief to the poor under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package that was announced on March 26. The package provided an amount of Rs 500 per month for three months to women PMJDY account holders. 
“A total of Rs 30,705 crore have been credited in accounts of women PMJDY account holders during April-June,” the statement said. 
Besides, about 80 million PMJDY account holders receive DBT from the government under various schemes.
The scheme involves opening of basic savings bank deposit accounts with minimal paperwork. The process of account opening is simple with relaxed know-your-customer (KYC) norms. These accounts are zero balance and zero charge accounts. Account holders are issued indigenous debit cards with free accident insurance coverage of Rs 2 lakh.
In August, about 86.3% (348.1 million) accounts were operative, the statement said. 
As per the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), a PMJDY account is treated as inoperative, if there are no customer induced transactions in the account for over a period of two years. 
At present, these accounts have a deposit balance of Rs 1.31 lakh crore, with an average deposit of Rs 3,239 per account. The average deposit per account has increased 2.5 times, which indicates increased usage of accounts and inculcation of saving habit among the account holders, it said.
The PMJDY account holders can also take help of ‘Jan Dhan Darshak App’, a mobile application, for locating banking touchpoints such as bank branches, automated teller machines (ATMs), Bank Mitras and post offices, it said.
There are over eight lakh banking touchpoints, it added.","Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana or PMJDY – the national mission for financial inclusion completed six years of its implementation on Friday. On the 6th anniversary of PMJDY, Ministry of Finance mentioned the achievements of the scheme in a series of tweets.
More than 40.35 crore beneficiaries banked under PMJDY since its inception, amounting to Rs 1.31 lakh crore, the Ministry of Finance said.
""As on August 19, 2020, 63.6 percent rural PMJDY accounts and 55.2 percent women PMJDY accounts were opened,"" it said.

About 8 crore PMJDY account holders receive Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) from the government under various schemes,"" the Press Information Bureau (PIB) mentioned in a release.
On the occasion, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also reiterated the importance of PMJDY and emphasized how this scheme has been the foundation stone for the PM Modi government’s people-centric economic initiatives.
“Whether it is direct benefit transfers, COVID-19 financial assistance, PM-KISAN, increased wages under MGNREGA, life and health insurance cover, the first step was to provide every adult with a bank account, which PMJDY has nearly completed,"" she said.
Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Anurag thakur also expressed his thoughts for PMJDY on this occasion.
“Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, PMJDY has brought the unbanked into the banking system, expanded the financial architecture of India and brought financial inclusion to over 40 crore account holders. A majority of the beneficiaries are women and most of the accounts are from rural India,"" he said.
""In today’s COVID-19 times, we have witnessed the remarkable swiftness and seamlessness with which DBTs have empowered and provided financial security to the vulnerable sections of society. An important aspect is that DBTs via PM Jan Dhan accounts have ensured every rupee reaches its intended beneficiary and prevented systemic leakage,"" he added.
PMJDY was announced by PM Modi in his Independence Day address on August 15, 2014.

3409472,1,2,Black National Convention puts spotlight on police brutality,'I Have A Dream': New march on Washington to mark fraught anniversary of King's speech - Reuters,"By: AP | New York | 
Published: August 28, 2020 6:23:28 pm
Friday's convention is expected to be the largest gathering of Black activists and artists, albeit virtual, since the historic 1972 National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana, which concluded with the introduction of a national Black agenda. (AP Photo/Hassene Dridi)Black Lives Matter activists are holding their first Black National Convention Friday, a virtual event that will adopt a political agenda calling for slavery reparations, universal basic income, environmental justice and legislation that entirely re-imagines criminal justice reform.
The gathering follows Democratic and Republican party conventions that laid out starkly different visions for America. It also comes on the heels of yet another shooting by a white police officer of a Black man – 29-year-old Jacob Blake – in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that sparked days of protests, unrest and violence.
And it comes on the same day as a commemoration of the 1963 March on Washington, where the families of an ever-growing list of police and vigilante violence victims will appear with civil rights leaders.
Friday’s live-stream broadcast will include policy proposals on such issues as voter suppression, reproductive rights, inequality in public education, housing insecurity and inter-communal violence, according to its agenda, shared exclusively with The Associated Press.
“These are absolutely public policies that the Democratic Party, state and local officials, or anyone who is looking to serve Black people can take up now”, said Jessica Byrd, who leads the Electoral Justice Project of the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 150 Black groups organizing the event.
In 2016, the coalition released its “Vision for Black Lives” policy platform which included early proposals for defunding police. The new agenda revamps much of that original platform with specific proposals that could lead to an eventual abolition of the criminal justice system as it exists today.
It takes on the pledge Wednesday by Vice President Mike Pence at the Republican National Convention, who defended police and called for an end to unrest in cities where arson, looting and violence have followed peaceful protests over police brutality. “Under President Trump, we will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line”, Pence declared. “And we’re not going to defund the police. Not now, not ever.”
Similar to the Democratic and Republican conventions, much of Friday’s Black Lives gathering will feature pre-taped conversations, performances and other presentations, including 28 mini- documentaries on the issues and addresses by Black organizers in California, Minnesota, Kentucky and Wisconsin.
Earlier this week, yet another flashpoint put police brutality in the national spotlight: The police shooting Sunday in Kenosha that left Blake paralyzed, according to his lawyers. The protests and unrest that followed left two people dead Tuesday.
“Anyone who is watching, who is both enraged or looking for action, will find a space” in the Black National Convention, Byrd said.
The nearly four-hour-long event, livestreaming on the website BlackNovember.org, was directed by award-winning writer and filmmaker dream hampton, who won acclaim last year for the “Surviving R. Kelly” docuseries. Hosts include activist and TV actress Angelica Ross of “Pose” and “American Horror Story” fame, along with Phillip Agnew and Kayla Reed, veterans of the Trayvon Martin protests and Ferguson Uprising, respectively.
“I have long thought there was great storytelling to do in the world of Black activism”, hampton told the AP. “The real stars have always been these organizers who get things done.”
Speakers include Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter Global Network; Tarana Burke, founder of the (hash)MeToo movement; Raquel Willis, a writer and transgender rights activist; and Eddie Glaude, chairman of the Center for African American Studies at Princeton University.
The Black National Convention was originally planned to take place in-person in Detroit, the nation’s Blackest major city. But as the coronaviruspandemic exploded in March, organizers shifted to a virtual event.
Friday’s convention is expected to be the largest gathering of Black activists and artists, albeit virtual, since the historic 1972 National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana, which concluded with the introduction of a national Black agenda.
Earlier in the day on Friday, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III, a son of the late civil rights icon, will hold a commemoration of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Sharpton and King will be joined at the Lincoln Memorial by the families of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and Blake, as well as representatives of the Martin and Eric Garner families.
The Black National Convention broadcast begins after the D.C. march has concluded.
“This is truly for Black people, to sit on our porches, or on the train, or socially distanced in a park, and to be like, ‘Look at us’ “, Byrd said. “There is nothing that we can’t do. And everything good in this country, we’ve been a part of.”

For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people were expected to march in Washington, D.C. on Friday to denounce racism, protest police brutality and commemorate the anniversary of the march in 1963 where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr made his “I Have a Dream” speech. 
In his historic and often-repeated speech, King envisioned a time his children would “one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” 
Its 57th anniversary comes at the end of a summer of racial unrest and nationwide protests, sparked by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African American, after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes. 
Earlier this week, protests seized Kenosha, Wisconsin, after police officers shot another African-American man, Jacob Blake, multiple times in front of his young children while his back was turned. Blake survived the shooting, but has been paralyzed, his lawyers told reporters earlier this week. 
Friday’s protest, called “Commitment March: Get Your Knee Off Our Necks,” was planned in the wake of Floyd’s death by civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton’s National Action Network. 
Ben Crump, the civil rights lawyer representing Blake and Floyd’s family, will speak, as will Sharpton, members of Floyd’s family, and King’s son, Martin Luther King III, among others. 
After speeches at the Lincoln Memorial, participants will walk to the Martin Luther King memorial about a half mile away. 
This summer’s uprisings drew parallels to those seen in 1968, after King’s own murder, five years after his famous speech. 
The march also comes as Black people suffered disproportionately from the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed about 180,000 Americans. Blacks have been more likely to be sickened and die from the virus and to lose jobs from the economic fallout. 
Washington requires people coming from so-called coronavirus high-risk states, which currently includes both Wisconsin and Minnesota, to quarantine for 14 days when visiting the district. 
Organizers say they are taking the pandemic into account by restricting access to buses from those states, distributing masks and checking temperatures. There will also be free COVID-19 testing provided at the event. 
Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who received national attention when the district painted “Black Lives Matter” on the street steps away from the White House, has warned attendees that it may be difficult to socially distance during the march. 
In addition to the live march, there will be a virtual commemoration featuring Reverend William Barber, a prominent civil rights activist and the co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign. It will also include civil rights activists, politicians, artists and entertainers. 
Kerrigan Williams, a founder of Freedom Fighters DC, said the group was organizing its own march on Friday after the March on Washington to promote a more radical agenda that includes replacing police departments with other public safety systems. 
She said the group believes “the march on Washington is too reformist and performative for our taste.” 
Separately, a wing of the Movement for Black Lives, a network of Black activists and organizations, has scheduled the “Black National Convention” on Friday night, following national conventions by the Democratic and Republican parties over the past two weeks. 
The three-hour livestreamed convention, which has been in the works since last fall, will feature about 100 Black activists and discussions about criminal justice and capitalism, said Jessica Byrd, an organizer for the event. 
“We feel like it’s going to be a Black political Homecoming weekend,” she said.

471429,1,2,Pakistan ‘grudgingly acknowledged’ presence of terrorists on its soil: Jaishankar,"‘Paints itself as victim, shelters terrorists’: Jaishankar pans Pakistan - Hindustan Times","The external affairs minister said it is for the international systems to create necessary mechanisms to shut down structures supporting terrorism. (File)External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday slammed Pakistan for portraying itself as a victim of terror, and said it had to grudgingly acknowledge the presence of wanted terrorists and crime leaders on its soil due to international pressure.
While presiding over the Darbari Seth memorial lecture, he said the 9/11 terror attacks in the US and the Covid-19pandemic are stand-out moments that disrupted the trajectory of human society.
He said today, the world has a range of mechanisms to counter-terrorism, including the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), several UN sanctions committees and the Counter Terrorism Executive Directorate. But it lacks a comprehensive convention on international terrorism as UN members are still wrestling with certain foundational principles, he said.
All the while, states that have turned the production of terrorists into a primary export have attempted, by dint of bland denials, to paint themselves also as victims of terror, Jaishankar said, in an oblique reference to Pakistan.
But as we have seen last week, sustained pressure through international mechanisms to prevent the movement of funds for terror groups and their front agencies can work. It has eventually compelled a state complicit in aiding, abetting, training and directing terror groups and associated criminal syndicates to grudgingly acknowledge the presence of wanted terrorists and organised crime leaders on its territory, he said.

For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App.","External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday criticised Pakistan for portraying itself as a victim of terror while grudgingly acknowledging the presence of wanted terrorists and crime leaders on its territory due to sustained international pressure.
Jaishankar didn’t directly name Pakistan in his remarks while presiding over the Darbari Seth memorial lecture. He described the 9/11 terror attacks in the US and the Covid-19 pandemic as “stand-out moments that disrupted the trajectory of human society”.
Nineteen years after the 9/11 attacks and 12 years since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the world has a range of mechanisms to counter terrorism, including the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), several UN sanctions committees and the Counter Terrorism Executive Directorate, he said. However, it lacks a comprehensive convention on international terrorism as members of the UN are still “wrestling with certain foundational principles”, he added. 
“All the while, states that have turned the production of terrorists into a primary export have attempted, by dint of bland denials, to paint themselves also as victims of terror,” Jaishankar said, a clear reference to Pakistan’s use of terrorism as an instrument of state policy.
“But as we have seen last week, sustained pressure through international mechanisms to prevent the movement of funds for terror groups and their front agencies can work. It has eventually compelled a state complicit in aiding, abetting, training and directing terror groups and associated criminal syndicates to grudgingly acknowledge the presence of wanted terrorists and organised crime leaders on its territory,” he said. 
Weeks ahead of an expected assessment of Pakistan’s counter-terror financing regime, Islamabad issued two notifications on August 18 to enforce UN Security Council sanctions on hundreds of terrorist individuals and entities, including Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed, Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar and Dawood Ibrahim. One of the documents listed three addresses in Karachi for Ibrahim, wanted by India for his role in the 1993 Mumbai bombings.
After the issue was widely reported in the Indian media, Pakistan’s foreign ministry said in a statement the notifications didn’t amount to “Pakistan admitting to the presence of certain listed individuals on its territory”.
Jaishankar acknowledged the “struggle against terror and those who aid and abet it is a work in progress”. He said, “It remains for the international system to create the necessary mechanisms to shut down the structures that support and enable terrorism, whether in South Asia or across the globe.”
The world, he said, also faces a structural challenge in improving the global architecture used to fight pandemics. In similar crises over the past century, the outbreaks occurred in remote sites or the monitoring systems managed to head off a crisis. “This time, however, the international warning systems, reporting protocols and response mechanisms were unable to prevent the spread beyond ground zero,” he said.
This has highlighted the need for a more enlightened and responsive multilateral system, and a “new, inclusive and non-transactional approach to multilateralism”, he said. “The reform of international organisations is not merely desirable but imperative. We need to modernise the international system, step by step, to make it fit for purpose, beginning by making each entity relevant to the age in which we live, not when it was created,” he added. 
This will require revisiting membership and structures of control, reorienting operational principles and rules, and rebuilding resourcing channels of key pillars of multilateralism, Jaishankar said.
Strengthening skill sets and creating a better enabling environment are the goals of the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” campaign since India can make a difference at the global level only by scaling up its capacities, he said.
The spirit of local action for global outcomes is reflected in India’s work with France to create the International Solar Alliance, whose framework agreement has so far been ratified by 67 countries, and the launch of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, Jaishankar said. 
The memorial lecture was delivered by UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres, who said India has all the ingredients for exerting leadership at home and abroad. He added the drivers are poverty alleviation and universal energy access – two of India’s top priorities.
“Scaling up clean energy, particularly solar, is the recipe for solving both. Investments in renewable energy, clean transport and energy efficiency during the recovery from the pandemic could extend electricity access to 270 million people worldwide – fully a third of people that currently lack it,” he said. He added, “These same investments could help create nine million jobs annually over the next three years.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pakistan-grudgingly-acknowledged-presence-of-terrorists-on-its-soil-jaishankar-6574297/,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paints-itself-as-victim-shelters-terrorists-jaishankar-pans-pakistan/story-W7UzvUDhwNbjTe7IvMA2xK.html

As Sadak 2 meanders between fake babas and greedy families, as it slaps on the melodrama and the rest of the cast goes through the paces, Sanjay Dutt really gets into the spirit of things. His Ravi is grizzled and shows his gut, but that doesn’t stop him from going head-to-head with the first baddie he sees. Don’t miss the smile on his face and the song on his lips as he goes at it. He brings the only moments of joy in this uniformly dreary outing.

The trouble with Sadak 2 is that it is so deeply entrenched in the worst aspects of 90s filmmaking that all of Dutt’s aching intensity and hell-for-leather action cannot free it. It’s a far cry from the superb cinema Mahesh Bhatt served us back in the day – I speak of Naam and Zakhm, Arth and Daddy. Sadak 2 regurgitates the most cliched, exaggerated pulp that Bollywood spewed out in the decade, and in the one preceding it.
The themes of death, suicide and mental illness are all pervasive in the film and are handled with all the finesse of a bull in a china shop. Aching for his lost love, Sanjay’s Ravi constantly talks of a ‘reunion up in the heavens’ and often tries to act on it. The one time his friend manages to drag him to the hospital, the doctor asks him what he would do if his house was on fire. His answer involves a can of petrol. Alia Bhatt’s Aarya, who is trying to unmask a ‘dhongi baba’ named Gyaan Prakash (Makrand Deshpande), is quickly labelled crazy and sent to the same doc. There is even a mention of her being threatened with electric shock therapy!
Written by Mahesh Bhatt and Suhrita Sengupta, the film looks dated from the word go. Makrand Deshpande’s cut-out hulks over a religious ceremony that is straight out of a Dan Brown book. This is perhaps the only time we really see anything remotely connected to religion or faith. Alia spray-paints the word ‘revenge’ on the cut-out before setting it afire. Amid this private Dussehra, she is chased around by the baba’s minions and ends up in the said hospital. 
An heiress, Alia goes on the run from the fake baba – an ungainly phrase, doesn’t help how many times the film says it -- who has got his hooks into her family too – father Yogesh (Jisshu Sengupta) and step mommy Nandini (Priyanka Bose). She hires Ravi, who is pining for his lost love (Pooja Bhatt, seen only in portraits), to drive her to Kailash to fulfil a promise she made to her dead mother. Coming along for the ride is her boyfriend (Aditya Roy Kapur). What follows are more twists than you’d see even in an Abbas-Mustan film, and each is more hilarious than the last one, finally leading us to one of the most cringe-inducing climaxes of any film this year.
Many veterans put in an appearance too – there is Gulshan Grover as Dilip Hathkata and Mohan Joshi as a corrupt police officer Rajesh. Weighed down by the ponderous story and sluggish pace, none of them add much to Sadak 2. Even the naturally gifted Alia Bhatt fails to rise above the expository dialogues and the leaden narrative. 
Montages from the original Sadak, interspersed through this iteration, never let us forget how half baked this product is. And then there are the self-referential nods – Makrand’s baba appears in drag, as a nod to Sadashiv Amrapurkar’s iconic Maharani from the first film, perhaps. It comes across as a cheap knock-off, a lot like this film.","Sadak 2 will stream on Disney Plus Hotstar.Sadak 2, starring Alia Bhatt, Aditya Roy Kapur and Sanjay Dutt, will begin streaming on Disney Plus Hostar from 7:30 pm today. The romantic drama is helmed by veteran filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt who has taken the director’s chair after 19 years. The film is a sequel to 1991 hit film Sadak, which chronicled the love story of a taxi driver Ravi, played by Sanjay Dutt, and a sex worker Pooja (Pooja Bhatt). Ravi helps Pooja to escape the world of the brothel, and the two decide to live together forever. The film’s music album, which boasted of melodies like “Tumhein Apna Banaane Ki”, “Hum Tere Bin Kahi Reh”, Rehne Ko Ghar Nahi and others, became a hit among music lovers and is still loved by many.
This is the first time that Mahesh Bhatt has collaborated with daughter Alia Bhatt for a movie. Around the announcement of Sadak 2, Alia had expressed her excitement of being directed by her father and called the film “a dream come true”. The film also marks Pooja Bhatt’s return to films almost after two decades. She has earlier worked with her father Mahesh Bhatt in films like Daddy, Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahin, Sir and Zakhm.
Sadak 2 seems to be a revenge story where Alia’s character is seeking revenge from a godman played by Makarand Deshpande. She is assisted by Dutt, who is reprising his role of a taxi driver from the original 1991 release, and her lover, played by Aditya Roy Kapur. Produced by Vishesh Films, it also stars Jisshu Sengupta in a significant part.
The film was set to have a theatrical release in March 2020, but got delayed due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. Later, the makers decided to release the film digitally on Disney Plus Hotstar.
Mukesh Bhatt of Vishesh Films had earlier said, “My gladiator Mahesh Bhatt is back to perform in the arena once again. Sanjay Dutt and him have a magical past and they share a bond which is beyond professional understanding. With Alia coming on board, Pooja being there and my daughter Sakshi, who is the co-producer of the film The three sisters will be seen performing important roles. I feel it is a very emotional moment for me to see this happening. Sadak is not just a project for me, it is very close to my heart.”",https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/sadak-2-movie-review-one-of-2020-s-worst-films-take-this-trip-at-your-own-risk/story-JRCdq0f5Ud70Wxq5h5YwCL.html,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/sadak-2-release-live-updates-alia-mahesh-bhatt-6573181/
5209270,1,2,Japanese PM Shinzo Abe resigns over worsening health - Livemint,"Newsmaker: Japan's Shinzo Abe sought to revive economy, fulfil conservative agenda - Reuters India","TOKYO :
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving premier, announced his resignation because of poor health on Friday, ending a stint at the helm of the world's third-biggest economy in which he sought to revive growth and bolster its defences.""I have decided that I will step down as prime minister, with the belief that I cannot continue being prime minister if I do not have the confidence that I can carry out the job entrusted to me by the people,"" Abe, 65, told a news conference.
He said he had decided to step down now to avoid a political vacuum as the country copes with its novel coronavirus outbreak.
""I apologize from the bottom of my heart that despite all of the support from the Japanese people, I am leaving the post with one full year left in my term and in the midst of various policies and coronavirus,"" Abe said. He similarly quit in 2007 after one year as premier, citing illness.
It was the second time Abe has resigned as prime minister because of poor health.
He has battled the disease ulcerative colitis for years and two recent hospital visits within a week had fanned questions on whether he could stay in the job until the end of his term as ruling party leader, and hence, premier, in September 2021.
As news of the resignation spread, Japan's benchmark Nikkei average fell 2.12% to 22,717.02, while the broader Topix shed 1.00% to 1,599.70. The selling wiped $47 billion off Tokyo's $5.7 trillion stock market value, which had more than doubled during Abe's tenure.
The resignation will trigger a leadership race in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) - most likely in two or three weeks - and the winner must be formally elected in parliament. The new party leader will hold the post for the rest of Abe's term.
Former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba and former foreign minister Fumio Kishida both quickly expressed interest in the top job, media reported. Among others whose names have been floated is Abe's close aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.
Whoever wins the party poll is likely to keep Abe's reflationary ""Abenomics"" policies as Japan struggles with the impact of the novel coronavirus, but may have trouble emulating the political longevity that may be Abe's biggest legacy.
""The broad picture remains in tact. In terms of economic and fiscal policy, the focus remains very much on reflation,"" said Jesper Koll, senior adviser to asset manager WisdomTree Investments.
""Longevity will be a struggle.""
On Monday, Abe surpassed a record for longest consecutive tenure as premier set by his great-uncle Eisaku Sato half a century ago.
""As head of the ruling party he worked hard on Abenomics for eight years,"" said Naohito Kojima, 55, a brokerage employee.
""There were various problems but if someone else had been leader, it's questionable whether they could have maintained a stable government as long as Mr Abe. He did various diplomatic negotiations and I think the pros outweighed the cons.""
Abe's resignation also comes amid an uncertain geopolitical environment, including an intensifying confrontation between the United States and China and ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.
FALLING SUPPORT
The conservative Abe returned as prime minister for a rare second term in December 2012, pledging to revive growth with his ""Abenomics"" mix of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and reforms. He also pledged to beef up Japan's defences and aimed to revise the pacifist constitution.
Under fire for his handling of the coronavirus and scandals among party members, Abe has recently seen his support fall to one of the lowest levels of his nearly eight years in office.
Japan has not suffered the explosive surge in virus cases seen elsewhere but Abe had drawn fire for a clumsy early response and what critics see as a lack of leadership as infections spread.
In the second quarter, Japan was hit by its biggest economic slump on record as the pandemic emptied shopping malls and crushed demand for cars and other exports, bolstering the case for bolder policy action to avert a deeper recession.
Abe kept his promises to strengthen defences, boosting spending on the military after years of declines and expanding its capacity to project power abroad.
In a historic shift in 2014, his government re-interpreted the constitution to allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two.
A year later, Japan adopted laws scrapping a ban on exercising the right of collective self-defence or defending a friendly country under attack.
But Abe proved unable to revise the U.S.-drafted, post-war constitution's pacifist Article 9, a personal mission that also eluded his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who quit as premier in 1960 because of uproar over a U.S-Japan security pact.
Abe resigned from his first stint as prime minister in 2007, citing ill-health after a year plagued by scandals in his cabinet and a huge election loss for his ruling party. He had since kept his illness in check with medicine that was not previously available.

Topics",", (Reuters) - Japan’s Shinzo Abe swept back for a rare second stint as prime minister in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values. 
Abe became Japan’s longest-serving premier in November 2019. But by the summer of 2020, public support had been eroded by his handling of the COVID-19 outbreak as well as a series of scandals including the arrest of his former justice minister. 
On Friday, a person familiar with the matter said he had decided to resign, news that followed days of speculation about his health. Public broadcaster NHK earlier said Abe wanted to avoid causing problems for the government due to his worsening condition. 
Abe first took office in 2006 as Japan’s youngest prime minister since World War Two. After a year plagued by political scandals, voter outrage at lost pension records, and an election drubbing for his ruling party, Abe quit citing ill health. 
“What worries me most now is that because of my resigning, the conservative ideals that the Abe administration raised will fade,” Abe subsequently wrote in the magazine Bungei Shunju. 
“From now on, I want to sacrifice myself as one lawmaker to make true conservatism take root in Japan.” 
Five years after resigning, which he blamed on the intestinal ailment ulcerative colitis, Abe led his conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) - ousted in 2009 - back to power. 
He then launched a three-pronged “Abenomics” strategy to beat persistent deflation and revive economic growth with hyper-easy monetary policy and fiscal spending, along with structural reform to cope with a fast-aging, shrinking population. 
Deflation proved stubborn, however, and his growth strategy suffered in 2019 from a sales tax hike and Sino-U.S. trade war. The COVID-19 outbreak the following year triggered Japan’s biggest-ever economic slump. 
At the outbreak’s onset, Abe was slow to close Japan’s borders and implement a state of emergency urging people to stay home and shops to close. Critics initially branded the response clumsy and later faulted Abe for a lack of leadership. 
Still, Japan’s death rate remained far below that of many other developed nations. 
DYNASTY 
Abe hailed from a wealthy political family that included a foreign minister father and a great-uncle who served as premier. But when it came to many policies, his grandfather, the late prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, seems to have mattered most. 
Kishi was a wartime cabinet minister imprisoned but never tried as a war criminal after World War Two. He served as prime minister from 1957 to 1960, resigning due to public furore over a renegotiated U.S.-Japan security pact. 
Five years old at the time, Abe famously heard the sound of clashes between police and leftist crowds protesting the pact outside parliament as he played on his grandfather’s lap. 
Kishi tried unsuccessfully to revise Japan’s U.S.-drafted 1947 constitution to become an equal security partner with the United States and adopt a more assertive diplomacy - issues central to Abe’s own agenda. 
Abe boosted defence spending and reached out to other Asian countries to counter China’s growing clout. He also pushed the passage of laws to let Japan exercise the right of “collective self-defence”, or militarily aiding an ally under attack. 
Revising the pacifist constitution remained a top priority for Abe, a contentious goal since many Japanese see the charter as responsible for the country’s post-war record of peace. 
Abe’s underlying agenda was to escape what he called the post-war regime, a legacy of U.S. occupation that conservatives argue deprived Japan of national pride. Reforming the education system to restore traditional mores was another of his goals. 
TOUGH STANCE 
First elected to parliament in 1993 after his father’s death, Abe rose to national fame by adopting a tough stance toward unpredictable neighbour North Korea in a feud over Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang decades ago. 
Though Abe also sought to improve ties with China and South Korea, where bitter wartime memories run deep, he riled both neighbours in 2013 by visiting Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, seen by Beijing and Seoul as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism.

In later years, he refrained from visiting in person and instead sent ritual offerings. 
Across the Pacific, Abe forged close ties with U.S. President Donald Trump, playing golf and engaging in frequent phone calls and meetings. 
He was reelected as LDP president for a third consecutive three-year-term in 2018 after a party rule change and, until the COVID-19 pandemic struck, some in the LDP had considered another rule change to allow him a fourth term.

2499771,1,2,"‘He doesn’t understand presidency’: Biden, Harris hit back at Trump - Hindustan Times",Trump has shown reckless disregard for well-being of American people: Kamala Harris,"Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for US president, countered President Donald Trump’s attacks on him from the convention with a string of tweets, pointing out the mushrooming Covid-19 cases and infections across the country. Biden held President Trump responsible for the protests that he sought to portray as lawlessness.
Kamala Harris, Biden’s vice-presidential nominee, had laid out a more detailed critique of the president’s handling of the Covid-19 epidemic and his response to the anti-racism protest in a prebuttal. She argued, “Trump doesn’t understand the presidency”.
“Remember: every example of violence Donald Trump decries has happened on his watch. Under his leadership. During his presidency,” Biden shot back in a tweet, to Trump’s portrayal of them as harbingers of the kind of lawlessness and chaos that will take place on Biden’s watch.

Trump has tried to position himself as a law-and-order president has used the anti-race protests to stoke fears about lawlessnesses tying them to the radical left-wing of the Democratic party, who he has argued, will be calling the shots in a Biden administration.
In his counter-attack, Biden sought to keep the focus on Trump’s key vulnerability - the Covid-19 epidemic which has killed close to 180,000 Americans and infected 6 million.
“From the moment COVID-19 emerged, President Trump downplayed the threat it posed, refused to listen to the experts, and failed to take action to contain its spread.,” he wrote in one tweet. “Now, we’re paying the price”.
In prepared remarks for the prebuttal, Harris said, Trump had displayed “reckless disregard for the danger a pandemic would pose to American lives. For the devastation, it would do to our economy. For the damage, it would do to communities of colour who have been subjected to structural racism for generations”.
“He never appreciated that a President swears an oath before God and country to protect America against threats seen and unseen. It’s his duty. It’s his obligation to protect us. And yet, he has failed. Miserably,” she added.","By: PTI | Washington | 
Published: August 28, 2020 4:31:52 pm
This was the first major policy attack by Harris against Trump after she was nominated by the Democratic Party as its vice-presidential candidate last week.Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic Party’s vice-presidential candidate, on Thursday blasted President Donald Trump for having “failed” in and “shown reckless disregard” for the well-being of the American people.
“Donald Trump has failed at the most basic and important job of a President of the United States. He failed to protect the American people. Plain and simple. Trump showed what we, in the legal profession, would call a reckless disregard for the well-being of the American people”, Harris said.
In a blistering speech hours before Trump was to the deliver his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention, Harris alleged that the president’s policies have been “a reckless disregard” for the danger a pandemic would pose to American lives.
“For the devastation it would do to our economy. For the damage it would do to communities of color who have been subjected to structural racism for generations. For the chaos that would upend our daily lives, make it impossible for many of our kids to go to school, make it impossible to live normally and with certainty”, she said.
“He never appreciated that a President swears an oath before God and country to protect America against threats seen and unseen. It’s his duty. It’s his obligation to protect us. And yet, he has failed. Miserably”, she said.
“Here’s the thing, Donald Trump’s incompetence is nothing new. That has always been on full display. But in January of this year, it became deadly. That’s when the threat of a virus that would endanger the world first emerged. Trump dismissed the threat. Joe Biden sounded the alarm”, she said.
“It would be the beginning of a pattern that persists to this day. Trump telling us not to worry, that the virus will, quote, ‘disappear’, that a quote, ‘miracle’ is coming. Joe Biden, saying we need a plan, a national strategy, a President who is willing to lead, willing to be a role model for our nation. For our children”, Harris said.
There was no immediate reaction from the president. He was scheduled to deliver his address to Republican National Convention. He and Vice President Mike Pence face challenge from former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate Harris. This was the first major policy attack by Harris against Trump after she was nominated by the Democratic Party as its vice-presidential candidate last week.
Harris alleged that Trump “caved” in when the US needed him to be tough on the Chinese government.
“On January 24th, he praised the transparency of the Chinese government. He said, quote, ‘China has been working hard to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.’ But they weren’t being transparent. They blocked public health inspectors from the CDC, from getting the access and information they needed to protect American lives”, she said.
“Donald Trump stood idly by. And folks, it was a deadly decision. Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Donald Trump froze. He was scared. He was petty and vindictive”, Harris said.
As President, Joe Biden will put a plan into effect on day one, she asserted. “Develop and deploy rapid tests with immediate results. Make sure testing, treatments, and ultimately, a vaccine reach all Americans, including communities of color, who have historically been left behind. Manufacture the medical supplies and protective equipment we need”, she said.
“And make them right here-in America, so we’re never again at the mercy of China and other foreign countries to protect our own people”, she added. A Biden Administration will put in place a nationwide mask Mandate-it’s not a burden to protect each other.
Harris alleged that before the virus hit, Trump made the country vulnerable. “After it was struck, he failed to do what was necessary. As it continues, he’s making it worse every day”, she said.

5825887,1,2,Whats next after Japan PM Shinzo Abe quits? Potential successors?,Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe set to resign – NHK,"The abrupt news that Japan's longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe is set to resign over a worsening health condition, set off a flurry of attention on Friday over the path ahead for the world's third-biggest economy.
His resignation announcement, expected Friday evening, will trigger an election in his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to replace him as its president, followed by a vote in parliament to elect a new prime minister.
Abe and his cabinet would continue to run the government until a new premier is elected but could not adopt new policies. The winner of the party election would then hold the post until the end of Abes LDP term in September 2021.
The new party president is virtually assured the premiership, since the party has a majority in parliaments lower house.
Usually, the party must announce the election for its leader a month in advance, and its MPs vote along with grassroots members. In case of a sudden resignation, however, an extraordinary vote must be called at the soonest date possible with participants narrowed to MPs and representatives of the partys local chapters.
Here are details of some likely contenders to take the helm.
TARO ASO
Finance minister Aso, 79, who also doubles as deputy prime minister, has been a core member of Abe's administration. Without a clear consensus on who should succeed Abe, LDP lawmakers could elect Aso as a temporary leader if Abe resigns.
In 2008, Aso was elected LDP leader and hence, premier, in hopes that he could revive the long-dominant party's fortunes. Instead, the LDP was ousted in a historic election defeat in 2009, languishing in the opposition for the next three years.
The grandson of a former premier, Aso mixes policy experience with a fondness for manga comics and a tendency towards gaffes.
SHIGERU ISHIBA
A hawkish former defence minister and rare LDP critic of Abe, Ishiba, 63, regularly tops surveys of lawmakers whom voters want to see as the next premier, but is less popular with the party's lawmakers.
The soft-spoken security maven has also held portfolios for agriculture and reviving local economies.
He defeated Abe in the first round of a party presidential election in 2012, thanks to strong grassroots support, but lost in the second round when only MPs could vote. Then, in a 2018 party leadership poll, Ishiba lost heavily to Abe.
He has criticised the Bank of Japan's ultra-low interest rates for hurting regional banks and called for higher public works spending to remedy growing inequality.
FUMIO KISHIDA
Kishida, 63, served as foreign minister under Abe from 2012 to 2017, but diplomacy remained mainly in the prime minister's grip.
The low-key lawmaker from Hiroshima has been widely seen as Abe's preferred successor but ranks low in voter surveys.
Kishida hails from one of the party's more dovish factions and is seen as less keen on revising the post-war constitution's pacifist Article 9 than Abe, for whom it is a cherished goal.
The BOJ's hyper-easy monetary policy ""cannot go on forever,"" Kishida has said.
TARO KONO
Defence Minister Taro Kono, 56, has a reputation as a maverick but has toed the line on key Abe policies, including a stern stance in a feud with South Korea over wartime history.
Educated at Georgetown University and a fluent English speaker, he previously served as foreign minister and minister for administrative reform.
He has differentiated his conservative stances from those of his father, former chief cabinet secretary Yohei Kono, who authored a landmark 1993 apology to comfort women, a euphemism for women forced to work in Japan's wartime military brothels.
YOSHIHIDE SUGA
Suga, 71, a self-made politician and loyal lieutenant since Abe's troubled term as premier in 2006 and 2007, was among a band of allies who pushed Abe to run again for the top post in 2012.
Back in office, Abe tapped Suga as chief cabinet secretary, acting as top government spokesman, coordinating policies and keeping bureaucrats in line.
Talk of Suga as a contender bubbled up in April 2019 after he unveiled the new imperial era name, ""Reiwa"", for use on Japanese calendars after the enthronement of the new emperor.
Suga's clout was dented somewhat by scandals that toppled two cabinet ministers close to him last October.
SHINJIRO KOIZUMI
The name of Koizumi, 39, now environment minister and the son of charismatic former premier Junichiro Koizumi, is often floated as a future premier, but many consider him too young.
He shares some of Abes conservative views and has paid his respects at Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni Shrine for war dead.
Koizumi has projected a reforming image on the basis of efforts to cut Japan's backing for coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, but has typically taken care not to offend party elders.
TOSHIMITSU MOTEGI
Currently foreign minister, Motegi, 64, previously served as economy minister, facing off with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in tough negotiations.
He also served as trade minister post under Abe when the latter returned to power in 2012, tackling talks on the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact.
Educated at the University of Tokyo and Harvard, Motegi was first elected to the lower house in 1993 from the then-opposition Japan New Party and joined the LDP in 1995.
KATSUNOBU KATO, YASUTOSHI NISHIMURA
As health minister, Kato, 64, was in the limelight in the early days of Japan's coronavirus outbreak but then Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, 57, a former trade official, emerged as point person on virus policy.
In 2015, Kato, a father of four, was handed the portfolio for boosting Japan's rock-bottom birth rate, a task that met little success. He is a former official of the finance ministry.
SEIKO NODA
Noda, 59, has made no secret of her desire to become Japan's first female premier. An Abe critic, the former internal affairs minister, who also held the portfolio for women's empowerment, fell short of backing to join the race for party leader in 2018.","By: Reuters |

4484024,1,2,Maharashtra stamp duty cut: Increased sales volumes of ready inventory to help govt recover revenue losses,Ready apartments likely to see more traction in Maharashtra post stamp duty cut,"The government may be able to cover for revenue loss from lower stamp duty and registration charges by way of increased sales, expected to be highest in the affordable and mid-income segments, according to a report by ANAROCK Property Consultants.
There are nearly 33,500 ready-to-move-in homes in MMR and Pune collectively with MMR having around 18,500 units and  Pune around 15,000 units. As many as 55,750 units are slated to be ready by March 2021 in both cities 32,850 units in MMR and 22,900 units in Pune.
To boost the stagnant real estate market hit by COVID-19, the Maharashtra government on August 26 decided to temporarily reduce stamp duty on housing units from 5 percent to 2 percent until December 31, 2020.
Stamp duty from January 1, 2021, until March 31, 2021, will be 3 percent, they said. The decision was taken at the state cabinet meeting on August 26.Also Read: Maharashtra government slashes stamp duty to 2% until Dec 2020 to boost demand
The reduced stamp duty charges are good news for buyers and developers as well as the state government. With no GST applicable on them, ready-to-move-in homes are the most compelling option for homebuyers in MMR and Pune in light of the Maharashtra Governments limited-period stamp duty cut.
""The combination of GST exemption, reduced stamp duty and the lowest home loan interest rates in almost two decades are a strong argument now favouring ready-to-move-in homes. If we additionally factor in the ongoing incentives being offered by developers, buyers in the state focused on zero wait /instant gratification homes are at a distinct advantage, said Prashant Thakur,"" director and head - Research, ANAROCK Property Consultants.
In the under-construction category, properties due to be completed in the next 6-7 months are the next best bet. While these are not exempt from GST, they are invariably priced 5-10 percent lower than their ready-to-move-in counterparts.
Another 55,750 units are expected to be completed in MMR and Pune by March 2021 the time when reduced stamp duty rates revert to normal. Of this total supply, MMR has 32,850 under-construction units while Pune has 22,900 units.Also Read: Will Maharashtra's 50% cut in stamp duty boost housing demand?
Of the total 33,500 ready homes in MMR and Pune currently, nearly 44 percent are in the affordable category priced less than Rs 40 lakh, followed by 26 percent in the mid-segment priced between Rs 40 lakh to Rs 80 lakh, 19 percent in Rs 80 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore price bracket, and the remaining 11 percent in the luxury segment priced over Rs 1.5 crore.
In MMR, out of the total 18,500 ready homes, approximately 46 percent are in the affordable segment, followed by 18 percent in the mid-segment, 18 percent in Rs 80 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore price bracket and the remaining 18 percent in the luxury segment.
In Pune, out of the total 15,000 ready units, 42 percent are in the affordable category, followed by 36 percent in the mid-segment between, 20 percent in Rs 80 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore price bracket and just 3 percent in the luxury segment.","MUMBAI: The reduction in stamp duty charges in Maharashtra for a limited period until March end is expected to push sale of ready-to-move-in apartments in key markets of the state as that would also offer the benefit of exemption from the Goods &amp; Services Tax (GST).
On Wednesday, the state government reduced the stamp duty on property registrations to 2% for transactions between September 1 and December 31 from current 5%. The stamp duty will be 3% for agreements to be registered between January 1 and March end.
The combination of GST exemption, reduced stamp duty and the lowest home loan interest rates in almost two decades is a strong argument now favoring ready-to-move-in homes. If we additionally factor in the ongoing incentives being offered by developers, buyers in the state focused on zero wait homes are at a distinct advantage, said Prashant Thakur, Director &amp; Head - Research, ANAROCK Property Consultants.
Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune, two key property markets in the country, have a total of around 33,500 such ready apartments, data from ANAROCK showed.
Experts believe, it is reasonable to assume that the government will be able to cover up for revenue lost in lower stamp duty and registration charges by ways of increased sales in the affordable and mid-income segments during the festive season.
With the total ready inventory in Mumbai and Pune region, the government can potentially earn revenue worth around Rs 656 crore including Rs 471 crore in MMR and Rs 185 crore in Pune at the stamp duty rate of 2%.
Homebuyers interest in ready and nearing completion projects has been on the rise even prior to this. However, it has started to pick up further post the announcement of reduction.
Over the last two days, the flow of enquiries for ready apartments in Mumbai, Pune and peripheral areas has increased post the stamp duty reduction. A major part of this is coming from the NRI (Non-Resident Indians) segment. This will also help in reducing ready inventory, which has been a fast moving category, said Kanika Gupta Shori, COO, tech-led property brokerage platform Square Yards.
Of the total 33,500 ready homes in MMR and Pune presently, nearly 44% are in the affordable category priced below Rs 40 lakh.
In the under-construction category, properties scheduled to be completed in the next 6-7 months are also expected to be preferred by homebuyers. While these are not exempt from GST, they are invariably priced 5-10% lower than their ready-to-move-in counterparts.

668328,1,2,"Amazon orders 1,800 Mercedes electric vans for Europe deliveries","Amazon orders 1,800 Mercedes-Benz electric vans for European deliveries - Reuters","Amazon.com Inc. is buying 1,800 electric delivery vans from Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, the retailer’s biggest commitment to date to cut the carbon footprint of its delivery operations in Europe.
The deal, for the German automaker’s eSprinter and eVito models, will be complete by the end of the year, Amazon said in a statement on Friday. It comes two years after Amazon agreed to buy 20,000 conventionally fueled Mercedes Sprinter vans to help build its package delivery operations in the US.
Amazon, which is increasingly delivering shipments with its own staff or contractors instead of relying on major carriers, last year announced a deal to buy 100,000 custom-built electric vans made by Rivian Automotive Inc. The electric truck startup expects to start production next year and complete the order by 2030. The Mercedes purchase makes it clear Amazon will also seek vehicles from other automakers to remove planet-warming greenhouse gases from its delivery fleet.
Electric vehicles are a major piece of Amazon’s effort to become a net zero emitter of carbon by 2040, an ambitious goal for a company that historically had lagged behind its retail and technology peers on the environment. As part of that initiative, Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos in September announced the Climate Pledge, an open invitation for other companies to match Amazon’s commitment and track and report their own emissions.
As part of Friday’s announcement, Mercedes became the fourth signatory to the pledge, joining three initial signers from earlier this year.
It’s unclear whether Mercedes, which had previously announced plans to make its passenger fleet carbon neutral by 2039, has agreed to any new environmental commitments as part of its participation in Amazon’s climate pact. Daimler has been reporting its carbon emissions to the public and global tracking organizations since at least 2010, according to data from CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project. Amazon disclosed its carbon footprint for the first time last year but hasn’t submitted data to CDP’s closely watched public tracker.
An Amazon spokesman said the Climate Pledge commitment was made by the Mercedes subsidiary, not Daimler as a whole, which also owns brands like American truck manufacturers Freightliner and Western Star. A Daimler spokesman said that by having the unit sign the Climate Pledge, the company is reinforcing its commitments and is “excited to join a community that will share knowledge, ideas and best practices.”","Aug 28 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Friday it had ordered 1,800 electric vans from Mercedes-Benz for its European delivery fleet, as part of the online retailer’s plans to run a carbon neutral business by 2040. 
A majority of the electric vehicles from Daimler AG’s car and vans division will go into service this year, the company said, adding that it had ordered 1,200 of Mercedes-Benz’s larger eSprinter models and 600 of the midsize eVitos. 
The order is the largest for Mercedes-Benz’s electric vehicles to date and includes 800 vans for Germany and 500 for the United Kingdom. 
It is dwarfed, however, by Amazon’s recent order for 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian Automotive LLC, a startup it has invested in. 
Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a statement the Daimler agreement was part of the retailer’s “journey to build the most sustainable transportation fleet in the world.” 
Mercedes-Benz on Friday joined The Climate Pledge, started by Amazon last year, which calls on signatories to be net zero carbon across their businesses by 2040. The automaker has previously said it was aiming to have a carbon neutral fleet by 2039. 
In 2018, Amazon became the biggest customer of Mercedes’ non-electric Sprinter vans, securing 20,000 vehicles for delivery contractors. 
“Moving forward, we are prioritizing the addition of electric vehicles,” Ross Rachey, Amazon’s director of global fleet and products for last-mile delivery told Reuters. 
Other delivery companies are pushing for more electric fleets. In January United Parcel Service Inc said it was ordering 10,000 delivery trucks from UK-based Arrival Ltd. 
Daimler’s rivals are also working on bringing electric vans to market. Ford Motor Co plans an all-electric version of its Transit van in North America in 2022, and General Motors Co aims to start production of an electric van in late 2021.

1778529,1,2,"Six Opposition-ruled states seek postponement, move SC over NEET, JEE","6 oppn-ruled states file review petition in SC against order to hold NEET, JEE exams - Hindustan Times","Ministers of six Opposition-ruled states moved the Supreme Court Friday against its order allowing holding of NEET and JEE physically, saying it failed to secure students' “right to life” and ignored “teething logistical difficulties” to be faced in conducting them during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The apex court’s August 17 order allowing the exams has become a political battle as the ministers from the six states — ruled by parties like Congress, TMC, JMM, NCP and Shiv Sena — sought postponement of the exams “in a manner that achieves the twin objectives of ensuring that the academic year of the students is not wasted and their health and safety is not compromised.” The review plea has been filed by ministers from West Bengal (Moloy Ghatak), Jharkhand (Rameshwar Oraon), Rajasthan (Raghu Sharma), Chhattisgarh (Amarjeet Bhagat), Punjab (B S Sidhu) and Maharashtra (Uday Ravindra Sawant).
The plea, filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes, said the apex court order fails to satisfy the safety and security concerns of students who have to appear for the exams.
The top court had refused to interfere with the conduct of the medical and engineering entrance exams, saying that life must go on and students can't lose a precious year due to the pandemic.
ALSO READ: Over 1.9 mn JEE and NEET aspirants download admit cards: Officials
National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts both the exams, has decided to hold NEET on September 13 and JEE Main for entrance to under-graduate Engineering Colleges and Institutes from September 1 to 6. The apex court had dismissed a plea by one Sayantan Biswas and others seeking direction to NTA to postpone them after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured that all safeguards would be taken.
Terming the decision to conduct exam as irrational, the plea said that the top court failed to appreciate that the Union government had adequate time to establish at least one centre for every district for NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) rather than having several centres in one district.
The petition said mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or their willingness or their desire to attend physical exams.
It said the August 17 order is “cryptic, non-speaking” and does not discuss various aspects and complexities involved in a matter of this magnitude.
ALSO READ: Hold NEET, JEE as per schedule for students' benefit: Shivraj Singh Chouhan
The plea said that only two reasons given by the court — life must go on and students should not lose an academic year — do not constitute an authoritative and comprehensive judicial scrutiny of the issue.
It said that apex court's observation that “Life Must Go On” may have very sound philosophical underpinnings but cannot be a substitute for valid legal reasoning and logical analysis of the various aspects involved in the conduct of the NEET UG and JEE exams.
“It is submitted that if the impugned order dated August 17, 2020 is not reviewed then grave and irreparable harm and injury would befall on the student community of our country and not only will the health, welfare and safety of the students/candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE examinations would stand imperilled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy in these Covid-19 pandemic times,” the plea said.
The petition said that as per the NIA press release, approximately 9.53 lakhs and 15.97 lakhs students have been registered for JEE (Main) and NEET (UG) 2020 respectively. The plea said that JEE 
Mains is slated to be conducted over 660 exam centres with 9.53 lakhs students appearing for it, roughly 1,443 students per centre.","Six opposition-ruled states have filed a review petition in the Supreme Court against its order allowing the central government to hold the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) in September.
West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Rajasthan have approached the top court against the August 17 order.

During the  meeting, CM Mamata Banerjee had suggested approaching the Supreme Court again for postponing the exams owing to the prevailing Covid-19 situation.

(File)The state Congress on Friday said there was a need to probe the BJP angle in actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case.

Speaking to mediapersons, state Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that the connection between BJP, Bollywood, Sandeep Ssingh and the drug nexus should be investigated.
Sandeep Singh is the maker of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s biopic.
The film has been made in 27 languages and the poster launch of the film was attended by then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Despite having several famous producers in Bollywood, how was Sandeep Ssingh chosen to produce Modi’s biopic? he asked.
Sawant further said that BJP’s insistence that the case be handed over to the CBI raises a lot of doubts.
Was Sandeep Ssingh the reason for bringing in CBI and ED such a hurry? he asked.
Denouncing Sawant’s demand, state BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhaye posted a link to a 2015 media article on twitter, which said Smita Thackeray, daughter-in-law of Bal Thackeray, was planning to produce a biopic on the late Shiv Sena chief in association with Sandeep Ssingh.

1033991,1,2,Walmart ad revenue could quickly jump if TikTok bid succeeds,What would Walmart get from buying Tiktok? The unusual marriage - Moneycontrol,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc could turn into an online advertising leader if its plan to acquire popular short-form video app TikTok goes through, analysts said on Friday. 
The proposed purchase, in partnership with Microsoft Corp, would allow the world’s largest retailer to quickly compete with Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google for eyeballs on social media, reaching customers across virtual and physical sales channels. 
TikTok is up for sale as the Chinese-owned company is under fire from the Trump administration as a potential national security risk due to the vast amount of private data the app is compiling on U.S. consumers. 
Walmart, which pitched its ad business to large consumer goods companies and advertising firms for the first time last year, said on Thursday it was “confident” it could meet U.S. TikTok users’ expectations and satisfy U.S. regulators’ concerns. 
TikTok owner ByteDance aims to ink a deal by Sept. 15, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. 
“Walmart is going to see a very quick rise in ad spend” if its bid succeeds, said Scott Smigler, president of e-commerce marketing agency Exclusive Concepts. 
“From a brand standpoint, it’s a no brainer because of the reach Walmart has and the huge shift we’re seeing right now from offline to online (spending). ... For all of our brands and retailers that are eligible, we’re going to want them on Walmart for sure.” 
Last week, Walmart posted its biggest-ever quarterly growth in online sales, as the unprecedented spike in demand seen by big-box retailers at the peak of the coronavirus lockdowns has remained strong even as restrictions ease. 
Walmart does not break out revenue from sponsored ads for products sold on its website. But online ads yield much higher margins than product sales, and ad revenue is growing as the retailer boosts investments in the area. 
It has been more important than ever for Walmart to find new ways to win market share from its closest e-commerce rival Amazon.com, a fast-growing ad platform, as customers increasingly shop online. 
Amazon reported $4.2 billion in advertising and other revenue for the most recent quarter, nearly double what it brought in for the same period two years prior. That amount is up 41% from the year-ago period. 
Retailers including Target Corp and grocers such as Tesco Plc have aggressively wooed big advertisers to their websites to drive sales through pop-up banners and search-bar keywords. 
In July, Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart rolled out new features for its in-house advertising platform Walmart Media Group. 
Walmart has seized many opportunities to scoop up online brands like Bonobos, which it purchased for $310 million in 2017, and Art.com, which it bought for an undisclosed amount in 2018. 
In 2010, Walmart announced its new video-on-demand service with its acquisition of Vudu, which also offers a free ad-supported streaming option. However, Vudu still lags far behind the monthly viewership numbers that competitors Netflix and Hulu pull in, and Walmart sold it to Comcast Corp-owned Fandango Media LLC, a movie ticketing service, in April. 
Investors are viewing Walmart’s play for TikTok as a potential win, and are raring to know more details. 
“It’s really hard to put a value on the return they’re (Walmart) going to get from this” possible acquisition, said Randy Hare, portfolio manager at Huntington Private Bank. 
“But clearly the market’s excited about this because this could really help Walmart with a new channel of advertising.” 
Reporting by Melissa Fares in New York; Additional reporting by Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru, Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Vanessa O'Connell and Richard Chang","In a surprising move, American multinational retail corporation Walmart has joined Microsoft to bid for the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok, which has come under fire from US President Donald Trump's administration.
TikTok has gained hundreds of millions of users globally but is facing resistance due to its ties with China. While the Indian government has banned the app, the White House is pushing TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell its US business if it wants to keep operating in the country.
Walmart's decision to bid for the video app has caught quite a few off guard. While the brick-and-mortar giant isn't the likeliest candidate to own an internet app, which is wildly popular with Generation Z, a look at the retailer's ambitions shows that the decision is part of a long-term plan to attract more shoppers, advertisers and vendors.
Through TikTok, the retail giant wants to significantly expand its customer base. Walmart believes it can scale its third-party marketplace and advertising businesses by joining hands with Microsoft and acquiring the video app.
""The way TikTok has integrated e-commerce and advertising capabilities in other markets is a clear benefit to creators and users in those markets. We believe a potential relationship with TikTok US in partnership with Microsoft could add this key functionality and provide Walmart with an important way to reach and serve omnichannel customers,"" a Walmart spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.

""We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of US TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of US government regulators,"" the retailer said in a statement. Walmart's shares were up about 4.4 percent after the news broke.
Microsoft and Walmart are already business partners as Microsoft provides cloud computing services that help run the retailer's stores and online shopping. The two companies signed a 5-year partnership in 2018, in a bid to counter shared rival Amazon.
The emergence of Walmart's bid follows the resignation of TikTok's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Kevin Mayer. After taking charge as CEO on June 1, Mayer quit TikTok less than three months on August 27, citing 'change in the political environment'.
""In recent weeks, as the political environment has sharply changed, I have done significant reflection on what the corporate structural changes will require, and what it means for the global role I signed up for. With a heavy heart that I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to leave the company,"" Mayer said in the letter.
In addition to Walmart and Microsoft, Oracle is also bidding for TikTok's US operations along with a coalition of investors. Backing the computer technology corporation, Trump had on August 18 said that Oracle was a great company that could handle buying TikTok.
The Trump administration is forcing a sale of TikTok's U.S. operations because of its Chinese ownership. US authorities are concerned that TikTok would turn over user data to Chinese authorities and that it censors content that would upset China.
ByteDance on August 27 said that it is moving fast to address issues related to its video-sharing platform TikTok's ban in India and the US.
Chairman of ByteDance Zhang Yiming said the company is moving quickly to find resolutions to the issues it faces globally, particularly in the US and India. ""I can assure you that we are developing solutions that will be in the interest of users, creators, partners, and employees,"" he said.
ByteDance launched TikTok in 2017, then bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the US and Europe, and combined the two.",https://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN25O2U5,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/what-would-walmart-get-from-buying-tiktok-the-unusual-marriage-5765401.html

(File)Defence Minister Rajnath Singh is likely to travel to Moscow for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Defence Ministers meeting on September 3 and 4, sources said on Friday. This will be his second visit to Moscow since the border stand-off with China began in early May.
Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu on Friday told the Indian ambassador in Moscow, D B Venkatesh Varma, that he looked forward to meeting Singh in Moscow next week. Shoigu conveyed this at the India Defence Pavilion at Kubinka outside Moscow.
This will be an opportunity for Singh to also meet his Chinese counterpart Wei Fenghe, who is also likely to attend the SCO Defence Ministers meeting.
With Indian and Chinese soldiers locked in a border standoff for the last three-and-half months, this could provide an opportunity to resolve the situation.
On June 24, Singh and Wei had attended the military parade in Moscow to mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Germany in World War Two.
New Delhi is also considering sending External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to Russia next month, around September 9 to 11, where he will have the opportunity to meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and discuss steps to resolve the ongoing standoff.
If that works out, it will be their first in-person meeting, although the two have met via video conferencing during the Russia-India-China (RIC) Foreign Ministers meeting in June. They have also had a phone conversation on June 17, two days after the Galwan clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.
Before the SCO Foreign Ministers meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will chair a large-format meeting of BRICS foreign ministers on September 4, to be held via videoconference. At this meeting, views on topical international matters will be exchanged. This meet will be attended by Jaishankar and Wang, sources said.
Hectic diplomatic activity between New Delhi and Beijing is again gaining pace through Russian interlocutors. Ambassador Varma has been constantly in touch with Russian officials.
The Indian envoy also had a conversation with Deputy Minister in Russias Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov on Friday, in which topics of cooperation in multilateral associations and upcoming bilateral contacts at various levels were discussed, officials said.
Earlier this week, Raj Kumar, the Secretary of Defence Production, visited Moscow and held talks on the manufacturing in India the spare parts of Russian equipment supplied to India.
On the LAC stand-off, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Thursday had said that a complete disengagement requires re-deployment of troops by each side towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC.
It is natural that this can be done only through mutually agreed reciprocal actions. Thus it is important to bear in mind that achieving this requires agreed actions by both sides, he said.

The SCO defence ministers' meeting is taking place at a time when two of its member countries, India and China, are locked in a bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh.
The sources said Singh is likely to leave for Moscow on September 3 as the meeting is expected to take place the next day. 
It will be Singh's second visit to Moscow since June. He had represented India at the Victory Day Parade in Moscow on June 24 that commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War. 
Russia has also invited External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to attend the SCO foreign ministers' meeting on September 10. 
When asked whether Jaishankar will travel to Moscow for the meeting, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Thursday said the minister has received the invitation and a decision on his participation would be made known once it is taken. 
In a related development, India will send a tri-services contingent to Russia to take part in a multilateral war game next month which will also be joined by China, Pakistan and a number of other SCO member nations. 
Around 150 Indian Army troops, 45 Indian Air Force personnel and a number of Navy officers will form the Indian contingent for the exercise scheduled to be held in the Astrakhan region in southern Russia from September 15 to 26. 
Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in a standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh for over three-and-a-half months. Both the countries are holding talks at military and diplomatic levels to resolve the dispute. 
Russia has already said that India and China should resolve the border dispute through talks and that a ""constructive"" relationship between the two countries was important for regional stability. 
The SCO, seen as a counterweight to NATO, has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations which accounts for almost 44 per cent of the world population stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea. 
The aim of the SCO is to maintain peace, stability and security of the region.

(Express photo)Sharing the dais for the first time since their attempt to form a state government ended within 80 hours in November last year, NCP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, and BJP leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, came together to inaugurate two dedicated Covid care centres in the city.
The first event was held in the Auto Cluster in Pimpri-Chichwad, and the second one in Baner in Pune. At both events, the two leaders spoke about the pandemic situation in the state, and steered clear of any political comments. While Pawar is the guardian minister of Pune district, BJP is the ruling party in both Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation.
In his speech, Pawar said the administration has managed to increase the bed capcity by 2,200 to treat critical Covid patients in the district. The best facility has been set up at the Covid centre in Baner. The centre has come up under the Corporate Social Responsibility initiative, with the complete support of corporate houses, which is worth appreciating, he said.
The NCP leader and Fadnavis jointly felicitated representatives of the corporate firms who contributed to the effort, as well as civic officials, for setting up the centre in such a short span of time.
Fadanavis was accompanied by state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, who is also the MLA from Kothrud, and city MP Girish Bapat. We are going through a challenging situation due to Covid-19 and would come out of it with the combined efforts of everyone, said the leader of opposition.
In comments made after the event, Fadnavis said more testing to screen Covid patients was needed in Mumbai, The situation of Maharashtra is more serious than that of the country. There has to be maximum testing along with effective management of patients for treatment. Testing capacity has been increased in Pune but it still needs to be increased in Mumbai.
He pointed out that the positivity rate in Maharashtra was around 19 per cent, which should be below 5 per cent as per ICMR guidelines, while the mortality rate should be below 1 per cent, but was around 3.2 per cent in the state, higher than the national average.
In November last year, after government formation talks broke down between long-time allies Shiv Sena and BJP, Fadnavis and Pawar had, in a shocking turn of events, taken oath as chief minister and deputy chief minister, respectively. But when asked to prove their majority in the Assembly, both leaders had to resign. The NCP later teamed up with the Sena and Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.
Recently, after Pawar’s son Parth, a NCP leader, triggered controversy by demanding a CBI probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, the opposition BJP had welcomed his comments, leading to speculation that Parth was going to join the party. Both NCP and BJP, however, denied the rumours.

Ajit Pawar and Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis were seen together at the inauguration of a COVID-19 hospital in Baner area here on Friday.
The two had famously come together on November 23 last year when Fadnavis was sworn in as chief minister and Pawar as his deputy in a hush-hush early morning ceremony.
Pawar, an NCP stalwart, broke ranks to join the BJP leader to form government after the saffron party fell out with the Shiv Sena, but their government lasted only 80 hours as they could not muster the numbers.
On Friday, Pawar and Fadnavis stood side by side and addressed the gathering in Baner, though they painted different pictures of the coronavirus situation in the state.
Pawar, who is also guardian minister for Pune district, said in the last few days 2,200 hospital beds have been added for treatment of coronavirus patients in the city and neighbouring Pimpri Chinchwad.
Referring to the phase 3 human trial of the 'Oxford vaccine' which began in Pune earlier this week, he expressed confidence that soon there will be ""affirmative picture in the state and country"".
Fadnavis pointed out that every day on average 15,000 new cases are being reported in Maharashtra.
""The main concern is that the positivity rate of the infection is still 19 to 19.5 per cent. As per the ICMR, it should be 5 per cent and where there is high infection (rate), it should be 10 per cent,"" he said.
The BJP leader also said that the state accounts for nearly 40 per cent of coronavirus deaths in the country.
""Since our current death rate is still 3.2 per cent which is above the national average, it is a matter of concern,"" Fadnavis said.
State BJP chief and Kothrud MLA Chandrakant Patil and Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol were also present.

Party chief Sonia Gandhi urged the government to listen to the voices of students and act according to their wishes.
Opposition parties such as the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, the Shiv Sena and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) have demanded that NEET and JEE exams be deferred due to the Covid-19 pandemic and floods in parts of the country.
However, the central government has repeatedly made it clear that the exams will be held as per schedule with due precautions.
Six ministers of opposition-ruled states – West Bengal, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand - on Friday also moved the Supreme Court seeking review of its order allowing the Centre to hold NEET and JEE exams.
The Congress also held an online campaign - ‘Speak Up For Student Safety’ – with its leaders and workers extending support to the students on the social media.

“I feel for you because you are now facing a very difficult situation. The issue of your exams, of when they should be taken up is the most important issue, not only for you but for your family,” Sonia Gandhi said in her video message to the students. 
“You are our future. We depend on you to build a better India. Therefore, if any decision has to be taken regarding students’ future, it is important that it is being taken with your concurrence,” she added.
“I hope the government listens to you, listens to your voices and acts upon your wishes. This is my advice to the government,” Sonia Gandhi said in the nearly a minute-long video posted on the party’s Twitter handle.
The NEET is slated to be held on September 13, while engineering entrance exam JEE-main is scheduled between September 1 and 6. The Supreme Court had last week dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the two exams, saying, a “precious academic year of students cannot be wasted and life has to go on”. 
Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi also urged the government to hold a conversation with students and take a decision after arriving at a consensus.
“NEET-JEE aspirants’ safety should not be compromised due to the failures of the government. Government must listen to all stakeholders and arrive at a consensus,” he tweeted.
Rahul Gandhi also tagged a video of him urging the government to listen to students and take a decision only after reaching a consensus. 
“You are the students and you are going to take this country to new heights. Everybody understands what has happened over the last three or four months,” he said.
“Everybody understands the mishandling of Covid-19, the devastation that has been caused, the economic destruction, the pain that this country has had to bear. Now what I don’t understand is why you should be held responsible and why further pain should be imposed on you,” Rahul Gandhi told the students.
He alleged that the government has been incompetent, and asked why should the Centre force anything on students.
“It is important that the government listens to the students, they are wise, they have the interest of this country at heart and any decision that is made with regard to these exams is made after a conversation and after a consensus has been developed and this is my message to the government,” he said.
Rahul Gandhi urged the government to have a conversation with students and resolve this issue peacefully.
Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the government cannot ignore the voices of students and those of their concerned parents. 
“They are the future of our country. With the rising scale of the pandemic, is it fair to expose them to infection in this manner? Are they not our children too?” she asked.
Among those who joined the party’s online campaign by posting their messages and videos on the social media were senior party leaders such as Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mukul Wasnik, Shashi Tharoor, Manish Tewari, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Jitin Prasada and Raj Babbar.
Later addressing a joint virtual press conference with Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren said the Centre claims that thousands of students have downloaded their admit cards. 
“I don’t understand what kind of argument is this. If that is the case, then if someone has the life insurance, does it mean that he will die soon?” he asked.
Singhvi said these six states represent not only 30 percent of India’s population, but also represent 30 percent of India’s geographical area.
“The mental status of our students, mental situation, mental illness and mental situation is probably more important than physical constraints. They are under pressure, they are under pain, they are under fear, with 6 months of Covid and they are suddenly forced because you threw yourself into a corner, without thinking of alternative for 3-4 months, into a sudden press button, magic button kind of thinking - start giving exams from September 1,” he said. 
O’ Brien said the petitioners do not want the students to lose the academic year and the petition aims to ensure better safety and security measures for the students.","TMC's student wing protest against the NEET exam dates in Kolkata on Thursday.
Coronavirus India Updates: The Covid-19 recoveries in India have exceeded the active cases by over 18 lakh as of Friday while there has been a huge reduction in the fatality rate, the Centre, highlighting its ‘test, track and treat’ approach, said today. With more patients recovering and being discharged from home isolation and hospitals, the country’s recoveries is nearing 26 lakh, it added.
“Effective treatment of positive cases has resulted in a progressively dipping Covid case fatality rate, which is pegged at 1.82 per cent as on date,” the Union health ministry said.
With 77,266 cases in 24 hours, the Covid-19 tally in India rose to 3,387,500 earlier in the day with the death toll at 61,529.
Here is a look at the top developments: 
In its latest set of coronavirus guidelines for flyers, the Centre has allowed airlines to serve pre-packed snacks, meals and beverages on domestic flights depending on the travel time, and hot meals on international flights.
Besides this, the government has also directed passengers who refuse to wear a face mask in a flight to be put on the no-fly list, a senior official of the aviation regulator DGCA said. The airline and its cabin crew are sufficiently empowered under the existing DGCA rules to take action in this regard, the official added.
Airlines may serve pre-packed snacks/meals/pre-packed beverages on domestic flights depending on the duration of flight, an order issued by the Civil Aviation Ministry said on Thursday.

The apex court was hearing a petition filed by one Avinash Thakur, who sought direction to the Chief Election Commissioner to postpone the election till the state was free of Covid-19.
The SC also said the petition was premature, as the EC was yet to announce the schedule for the elections. The poll body, however, has announced a slew of guidelines for holding elections during the pandemic.

Targeting the BJP over the holding of the JEE and NEET exams amid the pandemic, Samajwadi Party Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said the party’s attitude towards students is “devoid of humanity”.
“Adamant on conducting JEE and NEET examinations, BJP has now clarified why it has changed the name of the Ministry of Human Resources. It is because its attitude towards education and students is devoid of humanity,” the former chief minister tweeted while tagging pictures of the protest by his partymen in the state capital on Thursday.
The Supreme Court today said that states and universities cannot promote students without holding final year exams. The court, however, added that they can approach the University Grants Commission (UGC) to seek an extension of deadline for holding the exams. Earlier, the UGC guidelines had asked universities to hold the exams by September 30.
States can postpone final year exams under Disaster Management Act but fresh dates have to be fixed in consultation with UGC, it said.

The apex court’s August 17 order allowing the exams has become a political battle as the ministers from the six states — ruled by parties like Congress, TMC, JMM, NCP and Shiv Sena — sought postponement of the exams “in a manner that achieves the twin objectives of ensuring that the academic year of the students is not wasted and their health and safety is not compromised.” The review plea has been filed by ministers from West Bengal (Moloy Ghatak), Jharkhand (Rameshwar Oraon), Rajasthan (Raghu Sharma), Chhattisgarh (Amarjeet Bhagat), Punjab (B S Sidhu) and Maharashtra (Uday Ravindra Sawant).
The plea, filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes, said the apex court order fails to satisfy the safety and security concerns of students who have to appear for the exams.
The top court had refused to interfere with the conduct of the medical and engineering entrance exams, saying that life must go on and students can't lose a precious year due to the pandemic.

National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts both the exams, has decided to hold NEET on September 13 and JEE Main for entrance to under-graduate Engineering Colleges and Institutes from September 1 to 6. The apex court had dismissed a plea by one Sayantan Biswas and others seeking direction to NTA to postpone them after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured that all safeguards would be taken.
Terming the decision to conduct exam as irrational, the plea said that the top court failed to appreciate that the Union government had adequate time to establish at least one centre for every district for NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) rather than having several centres in one district.
The petition said mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or their willingness or their desire to attend physical exams.
It said the August 17 order is “cryptic, non-speaking” and does not discuss various aspects and complexities involved in a matter of this magnitude.

The plea said that only two reasons given by the court — life must go on and students should not lose an academic year — do not constitute an authoritative and comprehensive judicial scrutiny of the issue.
It said that apex court's observation that “Life Must Go On” may have very sound philosophical underpinnings but cannot be a substitute for valid legal reasoning and logical analysis of the various aspects involved in the conduct of the NEET UG and JEE exams.
“It is submitted that if the impugned order dated August 17, 2020 is not reviewed then grave and irreparable harm and injury would befall on the student community of our country and not only will the health, welfare and safety of the students/candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE examinations would stand imperilled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy in these Covid-19 pandemic times,” the plea said.
The petition said that as per the NIA press release, approximately 9.53 lakhs and 15.97 lakhs students have been registered for JEE (Main) and NEET (UG) 2020 respectively. The plea said that JEE 
Mains is slated to be conducted over 660 exam centres with 9.53 lakhs students appearing for it, roughly 1,443 students per centre.","As the chorus for the postponement on the upcoming NEET, JEE 2020 examinations rises, West Bengal chief minister today said that the Centre's decision to conduct the exams during the pandemic will lead to students risking their lives.Mamata was speaking at a virtual rally of TMC student wing. She also added, ""Centre is busy issuing sermons, it should instead listen to 'Mann Ki Baat' of students.""
Earlier in the day, ministers of six opposition-ruled states moved the Supreme Court seeking review of its order permitting the Centre to conduct NEET and JEE entrance exams this year.
While the NEET is slated to be held on September 13, engineering entrance exam JEE-Main is scheduled between September 1-6.
Here are the major updates on the NEET, JEE 2020 debate:
1) Congress president Sonia Gandhi said that if the government takes any decision regarding the future of students, it should take it with their concurrence. In a video message which the Congress party tweeted, Sonia Gandhi said, ""My dear students I feel for you because you are now facing a very difficult situation. The issue of your exams of when they should be taken up and where is the most important for you and also your family.""

3) Maharashtra Congress chief and state minister Balasaheb Thorat on Friday slammed the Union government for its insistence on holding JEE and NEET exams amid rising coronavirus cases. This insistence ""when the COVID-19 positive cases has crossed 33 lakh was anti-student and anti-people"", he said.
4) Congress leader Sachin Pilot also held a protest in Rajasthan against the Centre's decision to conduct these examinations and demanded the Centre to postpone the examinations in view of coronavirus pandemic.
5) Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren also echoed the same concerns of several political leaders. He said,""They (Centre) said that lakhs of students have downloaded admit cards.

4496364,1,2,Over 400 million poor now have access to banks due to Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana: Finance minis... - Hindustan Times,"Jan Dhan scheme completes six years, benefits 40.35 crore people","The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), the country’s financial inclusion initiative that was launched six years ago, has more than 403.5 million accounts with total deposits in excess of Rs 1.30 lakh crore, the Union finance ministry said.
The scheme, which has become the basis of direct transfer of cash subsidy to the poor, was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech on August 15, 2014, and was launched on August 28 that year.
“Today, six years ago, the PMJDY was launched with an ambitious aim of banking the unbanked. This initiative has been a game-changer, serving as the foundation for several poverty alleviation initiatives, benefitting crores of people,” PM Modi tweeted on Friday.
The government is planning to expand the scheme to provide insurance coverage to PMJDY account holders. “Eligible PMJDY account holders will be sought to be covered under PMJJBY [Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana] and PMSBY [Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana]. Banks have already been communicated about the same,” it said in a statement.
The government is also planning to promote digital payments, including RuPay debit card usage, among PMJDY account holders through creation of acceptance infrastructure across the country and provide access of the account holders to micro-credit and micro investment facilities, it added. 
According to the statement, as on August 19, out of the total PMJDY account holders, 63.6% were in rural areas and 55.2% accounts belonged to women. “Thanks to the PMJDY, the future of several families has become secure. A high proportion of beneficiaries are from rural areas and are women,” the PM said in another tweet.
Financial inclusion is a national priority of the government, as it is an enabler for inclusive growth, the finance ministry said. “It is important as it provides an avenue to the poor for bringing their savings into the formal financial system, an avenue to remit money to their families in villages besides taking them out of the clutches of the usurious money lenders,” it added.
“The PMJDY has been the foundation stone for the Modi government’s people-centric economic initiatives. Whether it is direct benefit transfers (DBTs), coronavirus disease (Covid-19) financial assistance, PM-KISAN, increased wages under the MGNREGA [Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005], life and health insurance cover, the first step was to provide every adult with a bank account, which PMJDY has nearly completed,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.
The PMJDY became an important instrument to expeditiously provide relief to the poor under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package that was announced on March 26. The package provided an amount of Rs 500 per month for three months to women PMJDY account holders. 
“A total of Rs 30,705 crore have been credited in accounts of women PMJDY account holders during April-June,” the statement said. 
Besides, about 80 million PMJDY account holders receive DBT from the government under various schemes.
The scheme involves opening of basic savings bank deposit accounts with minimal paperwork. The process of account opening is simple with relaxed know-your-customer (KYC) norms. These accounts are zero balance and zero charge accounts. Account holders are issued indigenous debit cards with free accident insurance coverage of Rs 2 lakh.
In August, about 86.3% (348.1 million) accounts were operative, the statement said. 
As per the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), a PMJDY account is treated as inoperative, if there are no customer induced transactions in the account for over a period of two years. 
At present, these accounts have a deposit balance of Rs 1.31 lakh crore, with an average deposit of Rs 3,239 per account. The average deposit per account has increased 2.5 times, which indicates increased usage of accounts and inculcation of saving habit among the account holders, it said.
The PMJDY account holders can also take help of ‘Jan Dhan Darshak App’, a mobile application, for locating banking touchpoints such as bank branches, automated teller machines (ATMs), Bank Mitras and post offices, it said.
There are over eight lakh banking touchpoints, it added.","More than 40.35 crore people benefited from the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) which was launched six years ago as a national mission for financial inclusion, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Friday.
The Jan Dhan Yojana, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day address in 2014, was launched on August 28, in the same year.
""The PMJDY has been the foundation stone for the Modi government's people-centric economic initiatives.

3821496,1,2,Focus of latest U.S. racial flashpoint shifts to accused Kenosha vigilante,"Teen charged in Kenosha fatal shooting that killed 2 protestors, hurt 1","KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - An accused teenage vigilante facing charges he killed two people protesting in support of Jacob Blake Jr., the Black man shot in the back by a white policeman in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was due to appear in an Illinois courtroom on Friday. 
Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was charged in Wisconsin with six criminal counts including first-degree intentional homicide, attempted homicide, reckless endangerment and possession of a dangerous weapon below the legal age of 18. 
He was scheduled to make his first court appearance in Lake County, Illinois, where he was arrested on Wednesday, for a hearing on a request from Wisconsin authorities to have him extradited from Illinois. 
Adding to the attention surrounding the case, Rittenhouse will be defended by a prominent law firm whose clients have included President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani and former Trump adviser Carter Page. 
Lawyer John Pierce told Reuters on Thursday that he and colleagues at the firm, Pierce Bainbridge, had been retained to represent the teenager and were determined to obtain justice for him. L. Lin Wood, another member of the Rittenhouse’s legal team, told CBS News his client had acted in self-defense. 
“He was not there to create trouble, but he found himself with his life threatened, and he had the right to protect himself,” Wood said. 
Sunday’s police shooting, in which Blake was gunned down and left paralyzed, turned Kenosha, a predominantly white city of about 100,000 residents on Lake Michigan, into the latest flashpoint in a summer of protests in the United States over police brutality and racism. 
The drive for racial justice was ignited on May 25 when George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, died in police custody under the knee of a white officer. 
Rittenhouse, a resident of Antioch, Illinois whose arrest warrant listed his occupation as a lifeguard, is accused of shooting three protesters, two fatally, during demonstrations on Tuesday night in Kenosha. 
Video footage from Tuesday’s incident shows a young, white gunman firing an assault-style rifle at protesters who tried to subdue him, then walking calmly away from the scene, hands in the air - with his rifle slung around his neck - as several police vehicles drive by without stopping him. 
According to the criminal complaint, another video shows Rittenhouse saying, “I just killed somebody,” after shooting one of his alleged victims, 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum, who was gunned down in the parking lot of a used-car dealer. 
TASERS USED 
In Kenosha, three nights of skirmishes between protesters and police following Blake’s shooting gave way on Wednesday and Thursday to peaceful, smaller demonstrations. 
The police officers involved in the incident, including Rusten Sheskey, a seven-year veteran of the police force identified by authorities as having fired all seven shots at Blake from directly behind him, have been placed on leave. 
Blake’s family and protesters have demanded the officers be fired and prosecuted. The investigation has been turned over to the Wisconsin Justice Department, while the U.S. Justice Department has opened a civil rights inquiry. 
The Wisconsin Justice Department said on Friday Sheskey and another officer, Vincent Arenas, made two separate attempts to stop Blake with tasers prior to Sheskey discharging his gun. 
It was the first time the identity of Arenas, an officer in Kenosha since February 2019, was disclosed. The department also identified the third officer on the scene as Brittany Meronek, who joined the Kenosha police force in January this year. 
The exact sequence of events leading to Blake’s shooting remain sketchy. 
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said on Wednesday the confrontation stemmed from a domestic complaint lodged by a girlfriend, and that investigators had recovered a knife from the front floorboard of the car that Blake was leaning into when Sheskey shot him from behind at point-blank range. 
Blake’s lead attorney, civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, said his client had no knife in his possession and did nothing to provoke or threaten police before he was shot. 
Protesters planned a march on Washington on Friday, commemorating the anniversary of the 1963 rally where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. 
The civil strife of recent months has drawn comparisons to the outpouring of anger and civil unrest that flared after King’s assassination in 1968. 
Reporting by Brendan McDermid in Kenosha; Additional reporting by Nathan Layne, Rich McKay, Daniel Trotta and Barbara Goldberg; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Frances Kerry","Prosecutors on Thursday charged a 17-year-old from Illinois in the fatal shooting of two protesters and the wounding of a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin, during a night of unrest following the weekend police shooting of Jacob Blake.
Kyle Rittenhouse faces charges of first-degree intentional homicide, one count of first-degree reckless homicide, one count of attempted first-degree intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment.
He would face a mandatory life sentence if convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, the most serious crime in Wisconsin.
The shootings late Tuesday largely caught on cellphone video and posted online and the shooting by police Sunday of Blake, a 29-year-old Black father of six who was left paralyzed from the waist down, made Kenosha the latest focal point in the fight against racial injustice that has gripped the country since the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.
The two men killed were Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, and Anthony Huber, 26, of Silver Lake, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of the city.
A third man was injured. Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, of West Allis, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Kenosha is recovering after surgery, said Bethany Crevensten, another activist. She said Grosskreutz was volunteering as a medic when he was shot and called him a hero.
Rosenbaum was shot and killed first, after following Rittenhouse into a used car lot, where he threw a plastic bag at the gunman and attempted to take the weapon from him, according to a criminal complaint released by prosecutors Thursday.
The medical examiner found that Rosenbaum was shot in the groin and back which fractured his pelvis and perforated his right lung and liver and his left hand. He also suffered a superficial wound to his left thigh and a graze wound to his forehead.
Rittenouse then ran down the street and was chased by several people shouting that he just shot someone before he tripped and fell, according to the complaint and cellphone footage. Huber, who was carrying a skateboard, was shot in the chest after apparently trying to wrest the gun from Rittenhouse, the complaint said.
Grosskreutz, who appeared to be holding a gun, then was shot in the left arm after approaching Rittenhouse, the complaint said. Rittenhouse's attorney, Lin Wood, said the teenager was acting in self-defence.
From my standpoint, it's important that the message be clear to other Americans who are attacked that there will be legal resources available in the event false charges are brought against them, he said.

3199145,1,2,"Trump accepts nomination, calls Biden 'destroyer of American greatness'","US Election 2020: Joe Biden will be destroyer of American greatness, says Donald Trump","US President Donald Trump castigated his Democratic rival Joe Biden as ""the destroyer of American greatness"" and assured voters that he will end the raging coronavirus pandemic that has ravaged the economy and quell the civil unrest, as he accepted the Republican nomination for a second term in office.
""This election will decide whether we save the American dream"" or whether ""we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny,"" Trump, 74, said on Thursday amidst cheers from some 1,500 ardent supporters who were mostly maskless.
My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States,"" he said in his 70-minute address from the South Lawn of the White House as hundreds of protesters staged a noisy demonstration outside against his policies.
I stand before you tonight honoured by your support. Proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future, we will build for America over the next four years, Trump said.
In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity! he said.
""We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before,"" he told the Americans as the country has witnessed over 180,000 deaths and over five million COVID-19 infections, making the the US the worst-hit nation.
Party's delegates from across the country at Republican National Convention, which has been drastically scaled down at its original venue of Charlotte in North Carolina, on Monday re-nominated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively.
This is for the first time in recent memory that a presidential candidate has delivered his acceptance speech from the White House.
Trump and Pence are being challenged in the November 3 elections by Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris.
Trump slammed Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness.
""He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness.""
Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history, Trump said.
The president said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered.
This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas, he said.
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens.
And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it, he said.
""Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism,"" he said.
Trump also referred to violent racial justice protests that have swept the nation in recent months following the killings of Black Americans.
The president said the Democrats at their party convention last week had disparaged America as a place of racial, social and economic injustice.
""So tonight I ask you a very simple question - how can the Democrat party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?
""In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins,"" Trump said.
Attacking his opponent's decades-long political life, Trump said: ""Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars.""
China, Trump said, would ""own our country"" if Biden wins and that only he would hold Beijing accountable for the ""tragedy they caused"" over the COVID-19.
Meanwhile, in an average of major national polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Biden leads Trump by 7.1 percentage points and in the battleground states it has come down to 3.7 percentage points, indicating that the presidential elections in less than 70 days is headed for an interesting finish.
Trump's acceptance speech concluded four days of star-studded convention of the Republican Party.
Earlier, Trump was introduced by one of his daughters, Ivanka, who said her father did not come to Washington to win praise from the Beltway elites, but to ""make America great again"".
""Washington has not changed Donald Trump.Donald Trump has changed Washington,"" she said.
Biden's running mate, Harris, delivered a speech hours before the president spoke, declaring: ""Donald Trump doesn't understand the presidency.""
""Donald Trump has failed at the most basic and important job of a president of the United States: he failed to protect the American people, plain and simple,"" the Indian-American senator said.
(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","Seeking another four years in the White House, US President Donald Trump has slammed Democratic rival Joe Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness.
Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration.
Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: Joe Biden is not the saviour of America's soul.""
He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness.""
Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history, Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election.
Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs, Trump alleged.
During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered.
This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas, he said.
This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades, he said.
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens.
And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it, he said.
Referring to the last week's Democrat National Convention, Trump said that Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice.
So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country? he asked.
In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history, he said.
Trump alleged that for 47 years, Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands.
Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, he alleged.
Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defence, he said.
Trump alleged that as vice president Biden supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry.
He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing (Qasem) Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as ""a positive development"" for America and the world. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win, he said.
China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused, Trump said.
He called Biden a Trojan horse for socialism.
Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden's America, he said, referring to violent protests there.
On November 3, he urged his countrymen to send the Democrats led by Biden a thundering message they will never forget! Joe Biden is weak"".

(File)Delhi High Court on Friday restrained private television channel Sudarshan News from broadcasting a show that students of Jamia Millia Islamia university said sought to incite hatred against them.
Also on Friday, the Supreme Court, after hearing a different petitioner on the same issue, declined to stop the airing of the show, saying it was important to be circumspect about imposing a pre-broadcast injunction.
The show, which had claimed to be an exposé on the infiltration of Muslims in the civil services, was not broadcast at its scheduled time of 8 pm on Friday.
Suresh Chavhanke, the owner and editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, said in a statement: To respect the Delhi High Court’s stay order, we’ve stopped the telecast of today’s ‘Bindas Bol’ programme. The subject of today’s ‘Bindas Bol’ was based on Bureaucracy Jihad. Chavhanke claimed this was the first time in the history of television news that a show has been stopped before its telecast.
A little over an hour before the show time, however, Chavhanke had posted on Twitter: Aaj raat 8 baje show hoga. (The show will be broadcast at 8 this evening.) The channel had not received an official notice, he said should we get such a notice, we will read it and give our version at 8 pm.
The petition in the High Court, filed by current and former students of Jamia, submitted that the show sought to defame, attack and incite hatred against Jamia Millia Islamia, its alumni and the Muslim community at large.
Chavhanke had tweeted a promo of the show a few days ago, in which he used the expression Jamia ke Jihadi.
In both the promo video and his tweet on Friday, Chavhanke used the hashtag UPSC_Jihad. In the statement issued on Friday night, he stressed that We strongly stand by the content shown in the promo of our programme.
The single-judge High Court Bench of Justice Navin Chawla issued notices to the central government, the UPSC, Sudarshan TV, and Chavhanke, and scheduled the matter for September 7.
Having considered the submissions made, till the next date of hearing, the respondent number 3 and 4 are restrained from telecasting the programme titled ‘Bindas Bol’, scheduled to be telecast at 8 pm today, Justice Chawla said in his order.
The petition in the Supreme Court was filed by Advocate Firoz Iqbal Khan. A Bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and K M Joseph declined to order a pre-broadcast stay on the show, and issued notices to the Centre, the Press Council of India, News Broadcasters Association and Sudarshan News, returnable by September 15.
At this stage, we have desisted from imposing a pre-broadcast interlocutory injunction on the basis of an unverified transcript of a forty-nine second clip, the judges said. The Court has to be circumspect in imposing a prior restraint on publication or the airing of views.
The Bench, however, noted that under statutory provisions, competent authorities are vested with powers to ensure compliance with law, including provisions of the criminal law intended to ensure social harmony and the peaceful coexistence of all communities.
Issuing the notices, the court said that prima facie, the petition raises significant issues bearing on the protection of constitutional rights, and together with free speech, there are other constitutional values which need to be balanced and preserved including the fundamental right to equality and fair treatment for every segment of citizens.
The plea relied on the transcript of the promo clip which was aired on the television channel in the course of the last week. The petitioner contended that the clip contains statements which are derogatory of the entry of Muslims in the civil services.
The petition in the High Court, filed by Advocate Shadan Farasat on behalf of the petitioners, said that in the promo, Chavhanke openly engaged in hate speech and defamation against students of Jamia Millia Islamia and the Muslim community, and has claimed that the success of Jamia Milia Islamia students in the Civil Services examination 2020 represents a conspiracy to infiltrate the civil service by Muslims.
Standing Counsel Anurag Ahluwalia, who appeared for the Union of India, submitted that several complaints having been received by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and a notice has been issued to the respondent number 3 (Sudarshan News) seeking its clarification.
Late at night, Chavhanke tweeted: …We have all the facts. We will go to the Supreme Court and the High Court and tell them how a fraud has been perpetrated on them. How, to crush our rights, the order of the Supreme Court was concealed.

The apex court refused to restrain pre-broadcast ban on Sudarshan TV from telecasting ‘Bindas Bol’ programme but the High Court in an interim order stayed the telecast of the show which was scheduled for today itself at 8PM.The news on the issue came from the high court where a bench of Justice Navin Chawla restrained the Sudarshan TV from telecasting its programme on the petition filed by former and present students of Jamia Millia Islamia University.
It also emerged that the matter was also dealt by an apex court bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and K M Joseph which said it has to first circumspect in imposing a prior restraint on publication or the airing of views.A lawyer said going by the judicial discipline and precedence, the apex court order would prevail on the Delhi high court’s order and in all likelihood the matter can be transferred to the apex court on upcoming dates of hearing.

1989295,1,2,"States cannot promote students without holding final year exams, rules SC","UGC final year exam: SC says students cannot be promoted without exams, but September 30 deadline not... - Moneycontrol","The Supreme Court Friday held that no state or university can promote students in the final year without holding exams as per the guidelines of University Grants Commission (UGC).
The top court also said that the decision taken by SDMA or state not to hold final year and terminal semester examination by September 30, in exercise of power under Disaster Management (DM) Act, 2005 shall prevail over the deadline fixed by the UGC.
A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R S Reddy and M R Shah said that if any state/union territory has taken a decision that it is not possible to conduct the final year /terminal semester exams by September 30, 2020, then they can make application to UGC to reschedule the date.
The decision of the State/State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) to promote the students in the final year/terminal semester on the basis of previous performance and internal assessment being beyond the jurisdiction of Disaster Management Act, 2005 has to give way to the guidelines of UGC dated July 6, directing to hold examination of final year/terminal semester, the bench said.
The State and University cannot promote the students in the final year/terminal semester without holding final year/terminal examination, it said.
According to the petitioners, several states like Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have decided to cancel the examinations and promote the students on the basis of previous performances.

The bench in its 160-page verdict said, We, thus, conclude that the State or the SDMA have no jurisdiction under DM Act, 2005 to take a decision for promoting the students on the basis of previous performance or internal assessment which decision being contrary to revised guidelines of the UGC cannot be upheld and has to give way to the guidelines of UGC which is the Authority to issue guidelines for determination and maintenance of standards of education and teaching of the Universities.
The bench added, if any State/Union Territory in exercise of jurisdiction under DM Act, has taken a decision that it is not possible to conduct the final year/ terminal semester examination by September 30, then we grant liberty to such State/Union Territory to make an application to the UGC for extending deadline of September 30, for that State/ Union Territory which shall be considered by UGC and rescheduled date be communicated to such State/Union Territory at the earliest.
The bench said that the differentiation made in the revised UGC guidelines of July 6 to hold final or terminal semester examination and to give option for earlier years/ intermediate semester for not holding the examination has a rational basis.
The differentiation has nexus with the object to be achieved. We, thus, reject the challenge to the revised Guidelines on the ground that there is any discrimination between the students of final year/ terminal semester and those of intermediate and first year, it said.
It added that the revised Guidelines also cannot be termed to violate Article 14 of the Constitution on the ground that one date that is September 30, 2020 has been fixed irrespective of the conditions prevailing in individual States and saying, the date for completion of examination was fixed throughout the country to maintain uniformity in the academic calendar.
The bench disposed of a batch of petitions filed by students, private organisations and Shiv Sena's youth wing Yuva Sena' challenging the UGC's July 6 directive to the universities to hold final year examination by September 30.","The Supreme Court has said that final year university exams will be conducted as per the rules of University Grants Commission. SC has also said that states cannot promote students without holding exams.
A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan pronounced the judgement on the student plea against UGC. This means that all final year university exams will have to be conducted.
However, the apex court said that of any state government or union territory cannot conduct exams by the September 30 UGC deadline, then they can individually approach the UGC to postpone it.
""State disaster management authority (SDMA) can postpone exams overriding UGC guidelines. However, SDMA cannot direct institutes to pass students based on previous performance,"" said the SC.
It added that states/UTs cannot pass students without exams as directed by UGC but have the right to approach the body seeking a postponement of the deadline.
On July 20, more than a dozen students had moved the apex court against this UGC decision. The petitioners want that the final year candidates be assessed based on the performance in the previous semesters.

On August 18, SC had reserved its order in the students' plea against the University Grants Commission's decision to make final-year exams compulsory. This plea is against UGC's July 7 decision asking institutes to conduct final year exams by September 30.
SC had asked all the parties to give a note on their submissions within the next three days. The hearing concluded on August 18.
State governments like those of Maharashtra, Odisha, Delhi and West Bengal had challenged the decision of the UGC to make it mandatory to conduct exams by September 30.
On June 26, the Maharashtra government had announced that there will be no final year examinations conducted for professional and non -professional courses in Maharashtra. The decision was taken in the wake of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, with Maharashtra reporting the highest number of cases.
However, UGC opposed this move saying that the state governments cannot decide to cancel examinations for final-year students. The body had also said that students cannot get their final degree without writing exams.

This was opposed by several state governments like that of Maharashtra, West Bengal as also by final-year university students.

Justice Navin Chawla, after hearing the matter for over two hours, declined to grant relief to Choksi saying a writ petition for enforcement of a private right cannot be maintainable.
The court said his remedy lies in a civil suit and granted him the liberty to raise the issue in a civil suit.
Choksi, the promoter of Gitanjali Gems, and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank fraud case.
Choksi left the country last year and was granted citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda.
The documentary, Bad Boy Billionaires', which is scheduled to be released in India on September 2, is described on Netflix platform as, This investigative docuseries explores the greed, fraud and corruption that built up - and ultimately brought down - India's most infamous tycoons.

The High Court held that a writ filed by Choksi was not maintainable. Earlier this week, spooked by Netflixs upcoming web series titled Bad boy billionaires featuring Vijay Mallya, Subrata Roy, Harshad Mehta and his nephew Nirav Modi, MehulChoksi had petitioned the Delhi High Court seeking directions to show him the series featuring him before release.
On Wednesday, the High Court had asked counsel for Netflix to receive instructions and explore the possibility of showing the web series to Choksibefore release. Counsel for Netflix said that it was highly unlikely that the series would be shown to Choksi prior release.
During the resumed hearing on Friday, counsel for Netflix emphatically said that while it was willing to show a preview to the Court but it would not give a preview to Choksi. 
Counsel for Netflix told the Court that the first part of the web series features Choksi only for two minutes and does not show anything pertaining his trial. 
The first part of the series is slated to be released on September 2.
Advocate Vijay Aggarwal, counsel for Mehul Choksi had argued that Choksi became aware of the Documentarys imminent release on August 24 when he saw the trailer and started receiving phone calls from various persons across the world, including from Delhi, asking him whether he was part of the Documentary and to solicit his comments qua the same.
The petition read thereafter, the petitioner discovered that one of the persons seen speaking in the trailer was one Pavan C. Lall who had written a book titled Flawed: The Rise and Fall of Indias Diamond Mogul Nirav Modi where also the Petitioners name had been comingled with Nirav Modis.
Aggarwal argued that Choski has been falsely accused of various crimes in India and is presently under investigation or standing trial by and before various authorities and/or courts as detailed comprehensively in the Petition.
He argued that the Petitioner (Choksi) is entitled in terms of Indian law, i.e. Article 21 of the Constitution of India to a presumption of innocence and a free and fair trial. Reputation being a facet of a persons life, the Petitioner is also entitled to a right to a reputation.
The petition further reads the settled principle has always been and must always remain that trial by media cannot be permitted and Courts are obligated to intervene and protect the rights of the accused where a premature or unfair portrayal in a motion picture would unfairly prejudice the accused persons investigation or trial.

The ministry made the submission while opposing a plea by diamond merchant Mehul Choksi, who sought a preview of Netflixs upcoming web series Bad Boy Billionaires: India before its release on September 2. Choksi, wanted by Indian agencies in the alleged Rs 13,570 crore fraud caused on Punjab National Bank, is one of the people featured in the docudrama.
The court rejected Choksis plea, holding that his writ was not maintainable. Choksi, however, has been given the liberty to file a civil suit.
The ministry told the court that it was an unnecessary party in Choksis petition. It said the relevant law did not afford powers in the statute allowing the ministry to interfere with the content on OTT platforms.
Choksis counsel Vijay Aggarwal argued that excessive publicity prejudices with legal proceedings and will adversely impact Choksis trial.
He asserted that the hunger of Netflix to remain unregulated needs to be regulated. Till the time the Union of India regulates OTT platforms, aggrieved individuals have to approach the court. Netflix may be asked to give a preview to the court, Aggarwal added.
Appearing on behalf of Netflix, senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul opposed Choksis plea. He said while Netflix was willing to show the web series to the court, it would not give a preview to Choksi.
Kaul said: Pre-censorship has the effect of killing free speech. Hitting out at Choksi, he said: It is a proxy litigation and not maintainable. He said Choksi featured only for two minutes in the forthcoming web series and that it did not have anything which would prejudice Choksis trial.
Describing Choksis petition as gross abuse, Kaul asked: Should an absconder be allowed to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of this court?
Another senior lawyer appearing for Netflix argued that Choksis petition was mischievous and misconceived. He averred that the petition was a ploy to prepare defence against his extradition.
While Netflix cited a Bollywood flick made on the alleged Adarsh housing scam to argue that a similar challenge seeking to stall the movie was rejected by the high court, Choksi cited 2G, Bofors and the 2002 Akshardham temple terror attack cases to counter argue that the accused in those cases were acquitted.
Choksis lawyer argued that Netflixs documentary might prejudice the minds of the public and investigative agencies, and cause irreparable damage to Choksi if he is acquitted in future.
Choksi had moved the Delhi High Court seeking a preview of the upcoming web series that also features Vijay Mallya, Subrata Roy, Harshad Mehta and Choksis nephew Nirav Modi.
Aggarwal argued that Choski had been falsely accused of various crimes in India and that he was currently under investigation or standing trial by and before various authorities or courts.
He said: The petitioner (Choksi) is entitled in terms of Indian law, i.e. Article 21 of the Constitution of India to a presumption of innocence and a free and fair trial. Reputation being a facet of a persons life, the petitioner is also entitled to a right to a reputation.
The petition added: The settled principle has always been and must always remain that trial by media cannot be permitted and courts are obligated to intervene and protect the rights of the accused where a premature or unfair portrayal in a motion picture would unfairly prejudice the accused persons investigation or trial.","The Delhi high court on Friday dismissed a plea by Mehul Choksi, the uncle of diamantaire Nirav Modi, seeking a preview of a series to be aired by video streaming platform Netflix next month.
The series, ‘Bad Boy Billionaires’, focusses on the fraud committed by many high-profile business tycoons in India. The poster released by Netflix shows Choksi’s nephew Nirav Modi, Subrata Roy of the Sahara Group, chairperson of the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines , Vijay Mallya, and Ramalinga Raju, the former chairperson and CEO of Satyam Computer Services.
The high court said Choksi can file a civil suit as what is being alleged as an infringement by him is a private right and can be exercised in a civil suit. It also refused to grant him a preview stating that there are no regulations to control the content being streamed on OTT platforms, citing a similar order passed by the division bench of the high court in a different matter.

Choksi had sought the postponement of the series, which is slated to be released on September 2.

He started receiving phone calls from across the world, including from Delhi, asking him whether he was part of the documentary and to solicit his comments.
Choksi further discovered, says the petition, that one of the persons seen speaking in the trailer was the writer of the book titled “Flawed: The Rise and Fall of India’s Diamond Mogul Nirav Modi” where his name had been co-mingled with Nirav Modi.
The petition said that Choksi fears his name may have been used in connection with Nirav Modi in the series even though his relation to the fugitive diamantaire is only that of an uncle and nephew. It also said that the series might have an episode on Choksi which has the potential of leading to a media trial. It said Choksi has the right to an innocent and free and fair trial and such a documentary would cause serious prejudice to his case.
The petition claimed that Choksi has been falsely accused of various crimes in India.

Published: August 29, 2020 4:10:29 am
Rhea Chakraborty arrives for questioning by a CBI team, in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) that is probing Rhea Chakraborty and three of her acquaintances under several sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, is set to arrest two suppliers of ‘bud’, the dried flower of the marijuana plant that sells for nearly Rs 5,000 per gram, a senior official has told The Indian Express.
Sources said the two suppliers have been detained, with contraband, and are likely to be arrested Saturday, as the NCB investigates the “demand” and “supply” of drugs linked to the case in which Chakraborty has been booked.
Chakraborty is also facing cases filed by the CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the death of fellow actor Sushant Singh Rajput.
An official said, “The suppliers will be placed under arrest on the charge of possessing narcotics. We will be questioning them to find out who all they supplied the contraband to and what was Rhea’s role in this.”
Chakraborty’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde had earlier said in a statement, “Rhea has never consumed drugs in her lifetime. Shes ready for a blood test any time.” There has been no discovery of any contraband from Chakraborty’s possession.
The official said bud, usually sourced from California, was a popular party drug and gives an instant high.
Officials claimed that the ED had recovered some deleted WhatsApp messages discussing drugs from Chakraborty’s phone, and shared the same with the NCB. Based on it, the NCB had registered an FIR.
The ED is also looking at an alleged money laundering angle in Rajput’s death. Having already questioned Chakraborty, her father and brother in connection with the case, the ED on Friday summoned Goa-based hotelier Gaurav Arya, to appear at its Mumbai office on August 31. A team from the ED pasted the summons outside the hotel run by Arya in Goa on Friday, after they couldn’t find him.
Sources said Arya would be asked about the transactions, if any, he had with Chakraborty. Arya, who moved to Goa around a year ago and owns a resort in Anjuna, had earlier told the media that he last talked to Chakraborty about three years ago and had never dealt in narcotics.
On Friday, the CBI questioned Chakraborty and her brother Showik for around 10 hours in an abetment to suicide case filed against her. Showik had been questioned on Thursday too. The agency also questioned Rajput’s flat mate Siddharth Pithani, and his two housekeeping staff.
The CBI has recreated the sequence of events on the day of Rajput’s alleged suicide. They have referred the report of his post-mortem, done at Mumbai’s Cooper Hospital, to a team of doctors at AIIMS.
The CBI took over the case from the Bihar Police, which had registered an FIR against Chakraborty and her family members based on Rajput’s father’s complaint.

While the Delhi High Court rejected absconding diamond merchant Mehul Choksis writ, a local Court in Bihar ordered interim stay on transmission of the series using the name of Subrata Roy, Chairman of Sahara India till the appearance of Netflixs counsels before the Court.
Opposing Choksis plea, the the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) told the Delhi High Court that freedom of speech and expression is cardinal and should be given full play. The Ministry said that it does not regulate the content on over-the-top platforms unless that interferes with national security.
On the other hand a Court in Araria, Bihar found force in a petition filed by Subrata Roy seeking stay on the transmission of the series.
This Court is of the considered view that the plaintiff (Subrata Roy) has qualified tripartite test of prime facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss and grant of ad interim injunction in its favour as such the defendants including their employees, directors, officers, associates or any person or entity acting on their behalf or under their authority are restrained from releasing, transmitting, distributing, exhibiting, performing or communicating to the public by any means or technology by audio or video performance of the impugned trailer and series of Bad Boy Billionaires using the name of Subrata Roy till the appearance of the defendant and filing show cause, reads the order.
The order further reads the order is interim in nature and the same shall be decided on merits after hearing both the parties.
Roy has alleged that a London based Director had met him in Lucknow in 2019 claiming that a web feature will be made on the life of Roy. He has further alleged that he was told that the web feature would be titled Billionaires.
Advocate Vivek Jha, counsel for Roy, contended that the series is an attempt to tarnish the image of Roy. It was further contended that by putting Roy in the series which also features fugitive economic offender Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Harshad Mehta, the producers are trying to assassinate Roys character.

The docuseries, which will be released worldwide on September 2, features, among others, Choksi’s nephew Nirav Modi, who is also an accused in the alleged fraud. Choski sought a preview of the show stating that he has the right to a fair and free trial and that he had apprehensions that the show could cause prejudice to the trial.
A look at Choksis petition and other similar petitions or cases by the accused against publication of books or release of films.
What did Mehul Choksi’s petition seek?
Choksi, the promoter of Gitanjali Gems Ltd, who has acquired the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda, submitted to the court that he had seen a trailer of the Netflix show in August and had received calls from various persons across the world to check if he was a part of it.
Choksi claimed he feared that his name may have been used in connection with his nephew Modi, who is featured in the show. He sought a pre-screening to allay these apprehensions and that appropriate reliefs — deletions or disclaimers — be available to him. The counsel for Netflix had told the court that Choksi was in the show only for two minutes, and it was not pertaining to the trial. The platform said that while it was ready to show the series to the court, a pre-screening could not be held for Choksi. The court, however, dismissed the writ petition stating that it was not maintainable since it was against a private entity and an appropriate civil suit could be filed.
On what grounds is relief usually sought against an upcoming book or film?
The basis of seeking relief in such cases is the ground that the publication of a book or a release of a film/documentary/show can cause prejudice to a pending trial. Choksi relied on Article 21 of the Constitution that guarantees equality before law, the presumption of innocence before being found guilty, and a fair and free trial.
Similar relief has been sought in other cases in the past as well. Relief is usually sought on grounds including Article 21 and Article 19, which, while guaranteeing freedom of speech and expression, imposes reasonable restrictions on grounds of contempt of court and defamation. Usually accused persons also refer to the damage that can be caused to their reputation.
Mumbai serial blasts and film ‘Black Friday’
An accused in the 1993 Bombay serial blasts case, Mushtaq Moosa Tarani, had approached the Bombay High Court in 2005 seeking a stay on the release of Black Friday, a film based on the book by journalist S Hussain Zaidi. Initially based on an application filed before the trial court by 31 undertrial prisoners in the case, the words ‘True Story’ was removed from the title of the film.

Tarani submitted to the high court that he feared the film will vitiate a fair trial and have a damaging effect on the impartiality of the administration of justice and would amount to contempt of court. The HC restrained the film from being released till the final judgment in the case is pronounced. It said the loss to the petitioner’s dignity and reputation would be irreparable as the viewers may form an opinion about his guilt. It also said that the release of the film will have a prejudicial effect on the administration of justice and the image of the accused. The filmmakers had approached the Supreme Court against this order but the film was allowed to be released only after the judgment in the case in 2006.
Abu Salem and book My Name is Abu Salem
 Gangster Abu Salem had sought relief in deferring the book ‘My Name is Abu Salem’Gangster Abu Salem, who was facing trial for the murder of Mumbai-based builder Pradeep Jain, had also sought a similar relief deferring the release of a book titled, My Name is Abu Salem, as the trial in the case was ongoing in 2014. The special trial court had restrained the sale of the book directing it to be withdrawn from stores and e-portals after observing that the consent of the accused was not taken and that it may cause him prejudice. The Bombay High Court, however, had set aside the order stating that the trial court did not have powers to do so.
Batla House
 A still from the movie ‘Batla House’In another case before the Delhi High Court in 2019, the accused persons in the Batla House encounter case in Delhi sought that a film titled Batla House be postponed till the pending trials conclude. The court had ordered for a pre-screening of the film witnessed by counsel of both sides. Both parties agreed to resolve issues in the film, including deleting certain scenes showing the accused making explosive devices, their confessions and an actual photograph of a Delhi Police personnel. After this, the film was allowed to be released last year.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday as a massive storm raced inland past the heart of the U.S. oil industry in Louisiana and Texas without causing any widespread damage to refineries.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 3 cents, or 0.1%, to $43.01 a barrel as of 0409 GMT.
WTI is on track to rise 1.6% rise this week, for a fourth straight week of gains.
Brent crude futures for October, set to expire on Friday, rose 2 cents to $45.11 a barrel, heading for a 1.7% weekly gain. The more active November contract climbed 3 cents to $45.63.
""With the U.S. Gulf hurricanes out of the way and preliminary assessment showing no damage to the upstream or downstream facilities, crude has surrendered most of the storm premium and could enter a holding pattern again,"" said Vandana Hari, oil market analyst at Vanda Insights.
Hurricane Laura hit Louisiana early Thursday with winds of 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour), damaging buildings, knocking down trees and cutting power to more than 650,000 people in Louisiana and Texas, but refineries were spared from feared massive flooding.
But investors are shifting their concerns from production outages to demand destruction, analysts said.
""Crude prices have barely budged this week, but refining margins have been hammered as flash floods disrupt normal consumption patterns, likely for a longer period of time than (Gulf of Mexico) production remains offline,"" said RBC Capital in a note.
U.S. producers had shut 1.56 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude output, or 83% of the Gulf of Mexico's production, while nine refineries had shut around 2.9 million bpd of capacity, or 15% of U.S. processing capacity, ahead of the storm.
Late on Thursday, the Port of Houston, the top U.S. crude oil export hub accounting for about 600,000 bpd of shipments, was in the process of reopening to commercial shipping late Thursday.
The earlier closures of Houston Port, Beaumont and Port Arthur were expected to reduce seaborne crude export capacity by nearly 1 million bpd, data intelligence firm Kpler estimated, based on average figures over the past four months.
In refining, Motiva Enterprises is preparing to restart its 607,000 bpd refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, the largest in the U.S., on Friday and Exxon Mobil Corp was preparing to restart units at its 369,024 bpd Beaumont, Texas refinery.

3909156,1,2,Focus of latest U.S. racial flashpoint shifts to accused Kenosha vigilante - Reuters Africa,"Teen charged in Kenosha fatal shooting that killed 2 protestors, hurt 1","KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - An accused teenage vigilante facing charges he killed two people protesting in support of Jacob Blake Jr., the Black man shot in the back by a white policeman in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was due to appear in an Illinois courtroom on Friday. 
Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was charged on Thursday in Wisconsin with six criminal counts of first-degree intentional homicide, attempted homicide and reckless endangerment. 
He was scheduled to make his first court appearance in Lake County, Illinois, where he was arrested on Wednesday, for a hearing on a request from Wisconsin authorities to have him extradited from Illinois. 
Adding to the attention surrounding the case, Rittenhouse will be defended by a prominent law firm whose clients have included President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani and former Trump adviser Carter Page. 
Lawyer John Pierce told Reuters on Thursday that he and colleagues at the firm, Pierce Bainbridge, had been retained to represent the teenager and were determined to obtain justice for him. L. Lin Wood, another member of the Rittenhouse’s legal team, told CBS News his client had acted in self-defense. 
“He was not there to create trouble, but he found himself with his life threatened, and he had the right to protect himself,” Wood said. 
Sunday’s police shooting, in which Blake was gunned down and left paralyzed, turned Kenosha, a predominantly white city of about 100,000 residents on Lake Michigan, into the latest flashpoint in a summer of protests in the United States over police brutality and racism. 
Rittenhouse, a resident of Antioch, Illinois whose arrest warrant listed his occupation as a lifeguard, is accused of shooting three protesters, two fatally, during demonstrations on Tuesday night in Kenosha. 
Video footage from Tuesday’s incident shows a young, white gunman firing an assault-style rifle at protesters who tried to subdue him, then walking calmly away from the scene, hands in the air - with his rifle slung around his neck - as several police vehicles drive by without stopping him. 
According to the criminal complaint, another video shows Rittenhouse saying, “I just killed somebody,” after shooting one of his alleged victims, 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum, who was gunned down in the parking lot of a used-car dealer. 
MARCH ON WASHINGTON 
The renewed drive for racial justice across the country was ignited on May 25 when George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, died in police custody under the knee of a white officer. 
Protesters planned a march on Washington on Friday, commemorating the anniversary of the 1963 rally where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. 
The civil strife of recent months has drawn comparisons to the outpouring of anger and civil unrest that flared after King’s assassination in 1968. 
In Kenosha, three nights of skirmishes between protesters and police in riot gear following Blake’s shooting gave way on Wednesday and Thursday to peaceful, smaller demonstrations. 
The police officers involved in the Kenosha incident, including Rusten Sheskey, a seven-year veteran of the police force identified by authorities as having fired all seven shots at Blake from directly behind him, have been placed on leave. 
Blake’s family and protesters have demanded the officers be fired and prosecuted. The investigation has been turned over to the Wisconsin Justice Department, while the U.S. Justice Department has opened a civil rights inquiry. 
The exact sequence of events leading to Blake’s shooting remain sketchy. 
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said on Wednesday the confrontation stemmed from a domestic complaint lodged by a girlfriend, and that investigators had recovered a knife from the front floorboard of the car that Blake was leaning into when he was shot from behind at point-blank range. 
Blake’s lead attorney, civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, said his client had no knife in his possession and did nothing to provoke or threaten police before he was shot. 
Reporting by Brendan McDermid in Kenosha; Additional reporting by Nathan Layne, Rich McKay, Daniel Trotta and Barbara Goldberg; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Frances Kerry","Prosecutors on Thursday charged a 17-year-old from Illinois in the fatal shooting of two protesters and the wounding of a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin, during a night of unrest following the weekend police shooting of Jacob Blake.
Kyle Rittenhouse faces charges of first-degree intentional homicide, one count of first-degree reckless homicide, one count of attempted first-degree intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment.
He would face a mandatory life sentence if convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, the most serious crime in Wisconsin.
The shootings late Tuesday largely caught on cellphone video and posted online and the shooting by police Sunday of Blake, a 29-year-old Black father of six who was left paralyzed from the waist down, made Kenosha the latest focal point in the fight against racial injustice that has gripped the country since the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.
The two men killed were Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, and Anthony Huber, 26, of Silver Lake, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of the city.
A third man was injured. Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, of West Allis, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Kenosha is recovering after surgery, said Bethany Crevensten, another activist. She said Grosskreutz was volunteering as a medic when he was shot and called him a hero.
Rosenbaum was shot and killed first, after following Rittenhouse into a used car lot, where he threw a plastic bag at the gunman and attempted to take the weapon from him, according to a criminal complaint released by prosecutors Thursday.
The medical examiner found that Rosenbaum was shot in the groin and back which fractured his pelvis and perforated his right lung and liver and his left hand. He also suffered a superficial wound to his left thigh and a graze wound to his forehead.
Rittenouse then ran down the street and was chased by several people shouting that he just shot someone before he tripped and fell, according to the complaint and cellphone footage. Huber, who was carrying a skateboard, was shot in the chest after apparently trying to wrest the gun from Rittenhouse, the complaint said.
Grosskreutz, who appeared to be holding a gun, then was shot in the left arm after approaching Rittenhouse, the complaint said. Rittenhouse's attorney, Lin Wood, said the teenager was acting in self-defence.
From my standpoint, it's important that the message be clear to other Americans who are attacked that there will be legal resources available in the event false charges are brought against them, he said.

She also added, ""Centre is busy issuing sermons, it should instead listen to 'Mann Ki Baat' of students.""
Earlier in the day, ministers of six opposition-ruled states moved the Supreme Court seeking review of its order permitting the Centre to conduct NEET and JEE entrance exams this year.
While the NEET is slated to be held on September 13, engineering entrance exam JEE-Main is scheduled between September 1-6.
Here are the major updates on the NEET, JEE 2020 debate:
1) Congress president Sonia Gandhi said that if the government takes any decision regarding the future of students, it should take it with their concurrence. In a video message which the Congress party tweeted, Sonia Gandhi said, ""My dear students I feel for you because you are now facing a very difficult situation. The issue of your exams of when they should be taken up and where is the most important for you and also your family.""
2) West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier this week said that opposition ruled states such as Maharashtra, Punjab, West Bengal, Jharkhand should collectively approach the Supreme Court for deferring NEET, JEE Main exams to be held next month
3) Maharashtra Congress chief and state minister Balasaheb Thorat on Friday slammed the Union government for its insistence on holding JEE and NEET exams amid rising coronavirus cases. This insistence ""when the COVID-19 positive cases has crossed 33 lakh was anti-student and anti-people"", he said.
4) Congress leader Sachin Pilot also held a protest in Rajasthan against the Centre's decision to conduct these examinations and demanded the Centre to postpone the examinations in view of coronavirus pandemic.
5) Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren also echoed the same concerns of several political leaders. He said,""They (Centre) said that lakhs of students have downloaded admit cards. I don't understand what kind of argument is this. If this is the case, then if someone has life insurance, does it mean they'll die soon.""
6) Ministers of six opposition-ruled states moved the Supreme Court against its order allowing holding of these exams physically, saying it failed to secure students' ""right to life"" and ignored ""teething logistical difficulties"" to be faced in conducting them during the COVID-19 pandemic.
7) The review plea has been filed by ministers from West Bengal (Moloy Ghatak), Jharkhand (Rameshwar Oraon), Rajasthan (Raghu Sharma), Chhattisgarh (Amarjeet Bhagat), Punjab (B S Sidhu) and Maharashtra (Uday Ravindra Sawant).
8) Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan today said that the NEET and JEE exams should be held as per their schedule so that one year of students does not go wasted. ""NEET-JEE is not a subject of politics, but it is linked to the future of students,"" he added. Uttar Pradesh government is in favour of holding the NEET and JEE, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Friday.
9) Additionally, over 150 academicians from various universities in India and abroad have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in written in support of conducting the exam, saying that delaying JEE-Mains and NEET any further will mean compromising the future of students.
10) Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' on Thursday said that with the number of admit cards being downloaded in the past few days, students want exams to be held at any cost.

Topics","A review petition was filed before the Supreme Court on Friday by ministers from six non-BJP-ruled states challenging an August 17 order of Supreme Court which had allowed the central government to hold the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE) in September despite the prevailing Covid -19 situation.
The review petitioners stated that the Supreme Court, in its August 17 order, failed to consider the safety and security of students who are slated to appear for NEET and JEE and also failed to take into account the logistical difficulties in conducting the examinations. 
“If the order of August 17, 2020 is not reviewed, then grave and irreparable harm and injury will befall the student community of our country and not only will health, welfare and safety of students appearing for NEET/ JEE stand imperilled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy in these Covid -19 pandemic times,” the petition filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes said. 
The six ministers who have filed the petition are Moloy Ghatak (West Bengal), Dr. Rameshwar Oraon (Jharkhand), Dr. Raghu Sharma (Rajasthan), Amarjeet Bhagat (Chhattisgarh), Balbir Singh Sidhu (Punjab) and Uday Ravindra Samant (Maharashtra).
NEET for students seeking admission to medical and dental courses is scheduled to be held on September 13 and the JEE for those aspiring to join top engineering schools is scheduled to be conducted from September 1 to 6.
A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra had, on August 17, rejected a plea filed in August by 11 NEET/ JEE candidates seeking postponement of the exams until after the Covid-19 crisis has passed.
Justice Mishra, while hearing that case on August 17, had said “life has to go on” despite the outbreak of the viral disease and the court cannot put the career of students in jeopardy by interfering with the decision of the National Testing Agency (NTA) to hold the examinations in September.
“Life has to move on even in Covid times. Covid may continue but postponement of exams is a loss for the country. Are you (petitioners) ready to waste a whole year,” justice Mishra had said.
On July 3, the NTA, the central government body tasked with conducting JEE and NEET, came out with public notices to hold the exams in September.
“The career of students cannot be put in peril. We find no merit in the petition. The petition is dismissed,” the bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, had ordered on August 17.
The review petition filed on Friday stated that the Supreme Court’s order of August 17 failed to consider that the decision to conduct examinations amid the ongoing pandemic increases the vulnerability of the students and their families to the risk of infection.
It was further submitted that the Centre had adequate time to make preparations for safe and successful conduct of the examinations but the intervening months from April to September were characterized by inaction and lethargy.
“Now the Union government has suddenly woken up to realise that their inertia is going to cost lakhs of students their academic year and therefore as a knee jerk reaction, the Union government has haphazardly and hurriedly fixed the dates of examinations,” the petition said. 
Further, the petition also said that students from rural areas and semi-urban areas might be forced to use unsafe modes of transportation to reach examination centres and would thereby expose themselves and everyone else to Covid -19.
Besides, students residing in distant placed will find it it difficult to reach examination centres due to limited availability of transportation services during Covid -19.
“Students in tribal pockets and remote areas will face an unfair hurdle to reach and stay at the examination centres compared to those already residing in urban areas or in the vicinity of exam centres,” the plea said.",https://www.livemint.com/education/news/neet-jee-2020-debate-centre-risking-lives-of-students-by-holding-sept-exams-says-mamata-10-updates-11598617824120.html,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-ministers-from-non-bjp-states-file-review-petition-in-supreme-court-for-postponement-of-neet-jee/story-9zNsgnsf3SQ5cVRAV6USOJ.html
633724,1,2,New Zealand's stock exchange resumes trading after cyberattacks,"New Zealand bourse resumes trade after cyber attacks, government activates security systems - Reuters UK","New Zealand's stock exchange resumed trading on Friday, after facing disruptions for four consecutive days in the wake of cyber attacks this week, while the government said national security systems had been activated to support the bourse.
There is no clarity on who was behind these two ""offshore"" attacks, but the failure to stop them has raised questions about New Zealand's security systems, experts said.
NZX Ltd had to halt trading until afternoon on Friday, after crashing earlier due to network connectivity issues, marking the fourth day that trading has been hit.
Finance Minister Grant Robertson said the Government Communications Security Bureau and the national agency fighting cyber crime had been called in to help the bourse.
""I can't go into much more in terms of specific details other than to say that we as a government are treating this very seriously,"" Robertson said in a media briefing in Wellington.
NZX was hit on Tuesday and Wednesday by distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, a common way to disrupt a server by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic.
The attacks forced NZX to halt trading in its cash markets, disrupting operations in its debt market, Fonterra Shareholders Market and derivatives market.
""Four days in a row is becoming frustrating and quite disruptive,"" said Jeremy Sullivan, an investment adviser at brokerage Hamilton Hindin Greene in Christchurch.
Activity is very low but institutional dealers are still able to put ""negotiated trades"" through the market by talking to each other directly, he added.
""The market's physically capable of running, they've put it in a halt so that people aren't disadvantaged with the website being down, which has material information on it."" NZX's main board, debt market and Fonterra Shareholders' Market resumed trading at 1:00 p.m (0100 GMT).
After the crash earlier on Friday, NZX had said it had been ""experiencing connectivity issues which appear similar to those caused by severe DDoS attacks from offshore this week"".
It did not give details on the source or the impact of the attack.
""We can see the internet traffic was coming through the global gateway, therefore we know it originated offshore, but it's near impossible to identify where it originated from,"" network service provider Spark told Reuters.
REPEATED ATTACKS
New Zealand, a relatively small economy with a population of five million, is not often the target of such attacks but neighbouring Australia ramped up its cyber security this year after a rise in similar incidents.
Australia said it would spend A$1.66 billion ($1.19 billion) over 10 years to strengthen the cyber defences.
New Zealand's central bank has said cyber attacks could wipe out about 2-3% of the profits of the banking and insurance industries each year.

5580364,1,2,Japanese PM Abe resigns over worsening health,"Newsmaker: Japan's Shinzo Abe sought to revive economy, fulfil conservative agenda - Reuters India","Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan’s longest-serving premier, said on Friday he was resigning because of poor health, ending a stint at the helm of the world’s third-biggest economy during which he sought to revive growth and bolster its defences.
“I cannot be prime minister if I cannot make the best decisions for the people. I have decided to step down from my post,” Abe, 65, told a news conference.
Abe has battled the disease ulcerative colitis for years and two recent hospital visits within a week had fanned questions on whether he could stay in the job until the end of his term as ruling party leader, and hence, premier, in September 2021.
As news of the resignation spread, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei average fell 2.12% to 22,717.02, while the broader Topix shed 1.00% to 1,599.70. The selling wiped $4.7 billion off Tokyo’s $5.7 trillion stock market value, which had more than doubled during Abe’s tenure.
The resignation will trigger a leadership race in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) - most likely in two or three weeks - and the winner must be formally elected in parliament. The new party leader will hold the post for the rest of Abe’s term.
Whoever wins the party poll is likely to keep Abe’s reflationary “Abenomics” policies as Japan struggles with the impact of the novel coronavirus, but may have trouble emulating the political longevity that may be Abe’s biggest legacy.
“The broad picture remains in tact. In terms of economic and fiscal policy, the focus remains very much on reflation,” said Jesper Koll, senior adviser to asset manager WisdomTree Investments.
“Longevity will be a struggle.”
On Monday, Abe surpassed a record for longest consecutive tenure as premier set by his great-uncle Eisaku Sato half a century ago.

“As head of the ruling party he worked hard on Abenomics for eight years,” said brokerage employee Naohito Kojima, 55.
“There were various problems but if someone else had been leader, it’s questionable whether they could have maintained a stable government as long as Mr Abe. He did various diplomatic negotiations and I think the pros outweighed the cons.”
Abe’s resignation also comes amid an uncertain geopolitical environment, including an intensifying confrontation between the United States and China and ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.
FALLING SUPPORT
The conservative Abe returned as prime minister for a rare second term in December 2012, pledging to revive growth with his “Abenomics” mix of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and reforms. He also pledged to beef up Japan’s defences and aimed to revise the pacifist constitution.
Under fire for his handling of the coronavirus and scandals among party members, Abe has recently seen his support fall to one of the lowest levels of his nearly eight years in office.
Japan has not suffered the explosive surge in virus cases seen elsewhere, but Abe had drawn fire for a clumsy early response and what critics see as a lack of leadership as infections spread.
In the second quarter, Japan was hit by its biggest economic slump on record as the pandemic emptied shopping malls and crushed demand for cars and other exports, bolstering the case for bolder policy action to avert a deeper recession.
Abe kept his promises to strengthen defences, boosting spending on the military after years of declines and expanding its capacity to project power abroad.
In a historic shift in 2014, his government re-interpreted the constitution to allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two.
A year later, Japan adopted laws scrapping a ban on exercising the right of collective self-defence or defending a friendly country under attack.
But Abe proved unable to revise the U.S.-drafted, post-war constitution’s pacifist Article 9, a personal mission that also eluded his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who quit as premier in 1960 because of uproar over a U.S-Japan security pact.
Abe resigned from his first stint as prime minister in 2007, citing ill-health after a year plagued by scandals in his cabinet and a huge election loss for his ruling party. He had since kept his illness in check with medicine that was not previously available.",", (Reuters) - Japan’s Shinzo Abe swept back for a rare second stint as prime minister in 2012 pledging to revive a stagnant economy, loosen the limits of a post-World War Two pacifist constitution and restore traditional values. 
Abe became Japan’s longest-serving premier in November 2019. But by the summer of 2020, public support had been eroded by his handling of the COVID-19 outbreak as well as a series of scandals including the arrest of his former justice minister. 
On Friday, a person familiar with the matter said he had decided to resign, news that followed days of speculation about his health. Public broadcaster NHK earlier said Abe wanted to avoid causing problems for the government due to his worsening condition. 
Abe first took office in 2006 as Japan’s youngest prime minister since World War Two. After a year plagued by political scandals, voter outrage at lost pension records, and an election drubbing for his ruling party, Abe quit citing ill health. 
“What worries me most now is that because of my resigning, the conservative ideals that the Abe administration raised will fade,” Abe subsequently wrote in the magazine Bungei Shunju. 
“From now on, I want to sacrifice myself as one lawmaker to make true conservatism take root in Japan.” 
Five years after resigning, which he blamed on the intestinal ailment ulcerative colitis, Abe led his conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) - ousted in 2009 - back to power. 
He then launched a three-pronged “Abenomics” strategy to beat persistent deflation and revive economic growth with hyper-easy monetary policy and fiscal spending, along with structural reform to cope with a fast-aging, shrinking population. 
Deflation proved stubborn, however, and his growth strategy suffered in 2019 from a sales tax hike and Sino-U.S. trade war. The COVID-19 outbreak the following year triggered Japan’s biggest-ever economic slump. 
At the outbreak’s onset, Abe was slow to close Japan’s borders and implement a state of emergency urging people to stay home and shops to close. Critics initially branded the response clumsy and later faulted Abe for a lack of leadership. 
Still, Japan’s death rate remained far below that of many other developed nations. 
DYNASTY 
Abe hailed from a wealthy political family that included a foreign minister father and a great-uncle who served as premier. But when it came to many policies, his grandfather, the late prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, seems to have mattered most. 
Kishi was a wartime cabinet minister imprisoned but never tried as a war criminal after World War Two. He served as prime minister from 1957 to 1960, resigning due to public furore over a renegotiated U.S.-Japan security pact. 
Five years old at the time, Abe famously heard the sound of clashes between police and leftist crowds protesting the pact outside parliament as he played on his grandfather’s lap. 
Kishi tried unsuccessfully to revise Japan’s U.S.-drafted 1947 constitution to become an equal security partner with the United States and adopt a more assertive diplomacy - issues central to Abe’s own agenda. 
Abe boosted defence spending and reached out to other Asian countries to counter China’s growing clout. He also pushed the passage of laws to let Japan exercise the right of “collective self-defence”, or militarily aiding an ally under attack. 
Revising the pacifist constitution remained a top priority for Abe, a contentious goal since many Japanese see the charter as responsible for the country’s post-war record of peace. 
Abe’s underlying agenda was to escape what he called the post-war regime, a legacy of U.S. occupation that conservatives argue deprived Japan of national pride. Reforming the education system to restore traditional mores was another of his goals. 
TOUGH STANCE 
First elected to parliament in 1993 after his father’s death, Abe rose to national fame by adopting a tough stance toward unpredictable neighbour North Korea in a feud over Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang decades ago. 
Though Abe also sought to improve ties with China and South Korea, where bitter wartime memories run deep, he riled both neighbours in 2013 by visiting Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, seen by Beijing and Seoul as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism.

In later years, he refrained from visiting in person and instead sent ritual offerings. 
Across the Pacific, Abe forged close ties with U.S. President Donald Trump, playing golf and engaging in frequent phone calls and meetings. 
He was reelected as LDP president for a third consecutive three-year-term in 2018 after a party rule change and, until the COVID-19 pandemic struck, some in the LDP had considered another rule change to allow him a fourth term.

7357480,1,2,Hurricane Laura carves destructive path across Louisiana,"Hurricane Laura makes landfall in US; 4 killed, extensive property damage","Windows blown out of a building by Hurricane Laura in Lake Charles, La., on Thursday, Aug. 27, 2020. (William Widmer/The New York Times)Written by Rick Rojas, Manny Fernandez and Richard Fausset
Soon after Hurricane Laura slammed into the Louisiana coast in the dark of night, a city of oil refineries and casinos some 30 miles inland awakened to scenes of unfolding chaos: A 22-story contemporary office tower in Lake Charles with windows stripped and smashed. A casino boat, wedged under the bridge over the Calcasieu River. Plumes of dark gray smoke from a chemical fire staining the blue of a post-storm sky.
Wind gusts, measured at up to 132 mph at the local airport, sheared the top of a sky bridge, tossed an RV on its side and downed power lines and trees. It even toppled a soaring monument to Confederate soldiers that the Calcasieu Parish Police Jury had declined to take down this month despite calls to do so from Black Lives Matter activists.
John ODonnell, 33, a leadership consultant who had fled Lake Charles earlier in the week with a bottle of bourbon and a cowboy hat in his passenger seat, was back in town Thursday morning surveying the large hole in the roof of his home and taking stock of his downtown block, a mess of felled trees and power lines.
The neighborhood is bad. Real bad, he said. Its worse than Rita.
In a region so accustomed to epic hurricanes that residents recall them by name, Laura was one of the strongest on record to hit the US mainland. It continued to carve a path of destruction and fear as it chugged north through Arkansas as a tropical depression Thursday night, and was responsible for at least six deaths in Louisiana most of them caused by trees falling on homes.
 A fire burns at a BioLab industrial site in Westlake, La., near Lake Charles, on Thursday, after Hurricane Laura passed through the region. (William Widmer/The New York Times)A day earlier, dire warnings of the storm sent more than a half-million people scurrying for safety on both sides of the Louisiana-Texas line. Hundreds of evacuees ended up in subsidized hotel rooms in lieu of large shelters, which government officials were wary of opening for fear of spreading a coronavirus that has already brought dozens of deaths to the region.
And although property damage appeared extensive, and the cost in dollars and lives was still being assessed Thursday afternoon, officials in both states sounded notes of cautious relief: Although Laura made landfall with 150 mph winds, its storm surge, predicted to come in at an unsurvivable maximum of 20 feet, proved to be a little more than half as high on the Louisiana coast, in part because the storm moved through so quickly.
It is clear that we did not sustain and suffer the absolute catastrophic damage that we thought was likely based on the forecast that we had last night, Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said in a Thursday afternoon news conference. But we have sustained a tremendous amount of damage. We have thousands and thousands of our fellow citizens whose lives are upside down.
The storm was one of a pair that threatened the Gulf Coast almost simultaneously this week. Tropical Storm Marco fizzled Monday, but Hurricane Laura grew to an unsettling Category 4 as it threaded a path between the Gulfs two great cities, Houston and New Orleans, both still traumatized by monumental storm-related flooding.
On Wednesday, Margaret Orr, a veteran New Orleans TV meteorologist still haunted by memories of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, began crying as she told her viewers of Lauras destructive potential.
The storm appeared to threaten both East Texas, inundated in 2017 by Hurricane Harvey, and west Louisiana, which was battered along with southeast Texas in 2005 by Hurricane Rita. But the Texans eventually realized that they were largely in the clear.
We dodged the bullet, said County Judge Jeff Branick, the top elected official for Jefferson County in Texas, which includes the cities of Beaumont and Port Arthur, in a Thursday morning text. Widespread power outages, but not the property damage, carnage and flooding weve seen in past storms.
The toll in Louisiana was greater, with nearly 404,000 customers without power Thursday morning compared with about 104,000 without power in Texas.
President Donald Trump will visit Texas and Louisiana and possibly Arkansas this weekend, he said at a Thursday news conference at the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The president said he had considered postponing his Thursday speech at the Republican National Convention. But now it turned out we got a little bit lucky, he said in regards to the hurricane.
Lake Charles, population 78,000, saw some of the most concentrated and visible damage not unlike the ruin it experienced when Rita tore through in 2005.
Building back from Rita had been a process that consumed Lake Charles for more than a decade. Now the work would begin again. But ODonnell said the city would rise to the challenge.
Im not proud of everything here, but Im absolutely proud of the people, he said. It doesnt matter: Black, white, yes we have our problems. There are all of these issues. But the people here love each other, and in times like this we band together and help each other. Especially in times like this. Thats why we stay.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for Louisianas emergency management office, said it would take time for officials to take stock of the damage in coastal communities where there were only a few routes to get in and out. But by noon Thursday, he said, his office had no reports of entire neighborhoods trapped in floodwaters and in dire need of rescue. Were optimistic that we did better than what was expected.
Still, state officials warned that water levels across Louisiana were dangerously high, particularly in Vermilion Parish and southwest Iberia Parish, coastal areas where water levels continued to rise Thursday afternoon. Aly Neel, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Department of Health, said there were at least 67 inoperable water systems around the state, some because of power outages but others that were perhaps more seriously damaged, affecting more than 220,000 people.
Sheriff Michael Couvillon of Vermilion Parish said officials had expected Hurricane Laura to bring 12 to 18 feet of storm surge to the parishs lowest-lying areas, which faced a mandatory evacuation ahead of the storm. But by Thursday afternoon, Couvillon said, the parish saw just half that.
God definitely blessed us, he said.
In Cameron Parish, search-and-rescue helicopters flew low over Holly Beach, a small coastal community in southwestern Louisiana a short drive from where the hurricane made landfall. But they kept on flying there was no one to rescue.
Although dozens of homes and trailers had been damaged or destroyed, residents had evacuated ahead of time.
Across the community, green-and-white street signs that had been ripped from their poles were littered on roadsides. There were bent trees and mangled stop signs. Air conditioners dangled from awnings by a few wires. Pieces of roofs and walls covered the streets.
These were the ravages not of the water but of the wind.
Elsewhere, experts were still trying to assess the damage to the petrochemical plants and other heavy industry that are the lifeblood of the regional economy and a source of potential environmental nightmares in the face of Gulf storms that are becoming more intense as a result of climate change that has been unleashed by the burning of those same fuels.
Phillips 66, Citgo and Motiva have major plants that were in the path of the storm. Inspections may be delayed by flooding and power outages, officials said. Gasoline and other fuel prices may not be elevated severely, at least in the short term, since there are ample inventories.
The fire that blackened the skies over Lake Charles originated at a storm-damaged chemical plant in the suburb of Westlake. Col. Kevin Reeves, superintendent of the Louisiana State Police, said that an undetermined amount of chlorine products began reacting and decomposing before generating heat and burning, releasing chlorine gas into the atmosphere. A shelter-in-place directive was issued for the surrounding communities.
A few miles to the east, the members of Lords Outreach Worship Center had spent the night praying, pleading for help and seeking a distraction from the barrage of wind and rain that shredded the surrounding neighborhood.
In this section of the city, like much of Lake Charles, roofs had been shaved off homes and businesses and trees had been toppled and upended. Severed tree limbs were strewn about yards and roadways, and ribbons of loose utility lines draped the otherwise empty streets.
On Thursday afternoon, a parade of utility crews and rescue workers filed in on nearby Interstate 10 from the east, their trucks bullied by the wind and rain still pounding parts of Louisiana. Along the highway, entire thickets of trees bowed toward the north, bent by the wind. Barns and sheds had collapsed, and large swaths of land were littered with debris.
Kolise Houston, 41, sat on a curb outside the church with a Sprite and a bag of Doritos. She described the booming and bamming of the powerful wind the night before. Houston, who lives in a nearby apartment complex, was also curious to know what had happened to her home.
I have no clue what it looks like, she said. I dont know if its still standing. I hope its still standing.

Laura, a category 4 hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 150 miles per hour and one of the strongest to hit the US, slammed the Gulf Coast early Thursday and roared through Louisiana. The bulk of the damage was reported in Louisiana. The storm barreled over Lake Charles, Louisiana, an industrial and casino city of 80,000 people.
President Donald Trump is expected to visit the Gulf Coast this weekend to survey the destruction caused by one of the catastrophic hurricanes in living memory here.
Speaking at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters, hours before the final night of the Republican National Convention, Trump said the campaign briefly considered postponing his convention speech until Monday so he could travel to Texas, Louisiana and possibly Arkansas to survey the damage, but ultimately decided to continue with the speech as planned.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were briefed in detail along with damage pictures by FEMA officials at its National Response Coordination Center.
""This team forward deployed resources,"" Pence said. ""We were ready for the worst, and by all accounts from the experts, while this was obviously a major storm with devastating impact, it was not as bad as it could have been.""
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told Trump that the situation on the ground ""is fluid and challenging,"" but the FEMA is responding. The hurricane's top wind speed of 150 mph put it among the most powerful on record in the US.
At least four deaths have been linked to the storm in Louisiana, Governor John Bel Edwards said Thursday. All of the victims died when trees fell on their homes. One victim was a 14-year-old girl in Vernon Parish. The other three are a 68-year-old man in Acadia Parish, a 51-year-old man in Jackson Parish, and a 64-year-old woman in Allen Parish.
Widespread power outages across Louisiana and Texas are increasing and as of 4 p.m. CST more than 8,40,000 people remained without power, according to data from PowerOutage.us. Louisiana is experiencing the worst of the outages with almost 6,00,000 people without electricity.
Videos shared on social media showed that wind blew out dozens of windows in high-rise office buildings, including the 22-story CapitalOne tower, ripped the top off a sky bridge, and tipped an R.V. on its side. The whistling winds mimicked the alarm-like sounds that could be heard inside buildings, according to videos on social media.
Laura damaged key transmission lines, conductors and some transmission towers that handle bringing power from the east. KHOU-TV said that the power utility is asking customers in the western area north of Houston to voluntarily curtail their power usage to help the infrastructure.
In Lake Charles, a regional hub known for its petrochemical plants and crowded casinos, commercial buildings were peeled apart, exposing insulation and wood frames. Billboards were punched out and trees snapped in half.
Fire broke out Thursday morning at a chemical plant in Westlake, local authorities said, sending thick smoke over a wide area and prompting shelter-in-place directives for residents in the communities of Westlake, Moss Bluff and Sulphur.
Mayor Robert Hardey of Westlake said the fire was burning at a plant operated by BioLab, a subsidiary of Kik Custom Products, which makes cleaners, antifreeze and other chemical products. A spokesman for the parent company, confirmed in a statement that the fire was the result of storm damage.
Meanwhile, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Thursday that his state dodged a bullet. He said there were still no confirmed fatalities in Texas nearly 12 hours after Laura made landfall and his state appeared to have made it through the storm with minimal or no loss of life, which he said was a ""miracle.""
Abbott toured the affected areas of East Texas Thursday and described seeing roofs sheared off buildings and uprooted trees following an aerial tour of the damage near their shared border.
Abbott said about 8,500 people were served in Texas shelters. He said the state minimized potential loss of life because residents in the storm's path heeded local advance warnings to evacuate.
Hurricane Laura made landfall overnight near Cameron, Louisiana, bringing ""catastrophic storm surge, extreme winds and flash flooding"" to portions of the state, the National Hurricane Center said Thursday. The storm had intensified rapidly into a Category 4 hurricane before slamming into the Gulf Coast near the Louisiana-Texas border.
By mid-Thursday, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm as it moved north over Louisiana, which took the brunt of the damage. It was continuing to bring strong winds and flooding rainfall to northern Louisiana and southeastern Arkansas, according to forecasters.
High water levels were persisting along the Gulf Coast. Tornadoes are possible through Thursday night in parts of Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi.

2253914,1,2,"EU urges Turkey to stop Mediterranean drilling, speeds sanction work",EU set to sanction Turkey over ships in disputed east Med exploration area - Reuters,"By: AP | Berlin | 
Updated: August 28, 2020 9:25:12 pm
In this photo provided by the Greek Defense Ministry, warships take part in a military exercise in Eastern Mediterranean sea, Tuesday, Aug. 25, 2020. Turkey is accusing France of stoking tensions in the eastern Mediterranean, where NATO allies Turkey and Greece are locked in a stiff standoff over competing claims over offshore energy exploration rights. (Greek Defense Ministry via AP)The European Union on Friday urged Turkey to halt its drilling activities in contested waters in the Mediterranean and ordered EU officials to speed up work aimed at blacklisting some Turkish officials linked to the energy exploration.
Tensions are mounting to breaking point between Turkey and Greece over Turkey’s drilling work near the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, which like Greece is an EU member country. Turkish and Greek armed forces have been conducting snap war games in the area.
Referring to what he called “growing frustration” with Turkey, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that the sanctions – which include asset freezes and travel bans – could be extended, with Turkish vessels being deprived access to European ports, supplies and equipment. Economic sanctions are also a possibility.
EU leaders will discuss whether to impose the additional measures at a summit in Brussels on Sept 24-25 should Turkey fail to stop what the Europeans consider to be “illegal activities” in the eastern Mediterranean near Cyprus.

“Turkey has to abstain from unilateral actions. This is a basic element to allow the dialogue to advance,” Borrell told reporters in Berlin after chairing a meeting of EU foreign ministers.
He said the EU is keen to establish a “healthier relationship” with Turkey, which is a candidate for membership in the 27-nation trading bloc, although its accession talks are virtually frozen.
“We must walk a fine line between preserving a true space for dialogue and at the same time showing collective strength in the defense of our common interests. We want to give a serious chance to dialogue,” Borrell said.
Turkey doesn’t recognize the divided island of Cyprus as a state and claims 44 per cent of Cyprus’ exclusive economic zone as its own, according to Cyprus government officials. Turkish Cypriots in the east Mediterranean island nation’s breakaway north claim another 25 per cent.
The Cypriot government has prepared a list of Turkish officials that it believes should face sanctions, and it is this list of names that EU officials will accelerate work on in coming days.
Cyprus was split along ethnic lines in 1974 when Turkey invaded in the wake of a coup by supporters of union with Greece. A Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence is recognised only by Turkey, which keeps more than 35,000 troops in the breakaway north.
It’s unclear whether sanctions might slow Turkey down. Steps were taken in the past – the slashing of funds meant to prepare Turkey for EU membership and the virtual freezing of its accession talks – yet Ankara has only become more vocal.
On top of that, Erdogan has shown his willingness to encourage migrants and refugees from Syria to cross the border into Greece and on to Europe, which remains deeply destabilized by the arrival of well over 1 million people in 2015, to ensure that his demands are well understood.
Turkey also plays a military role in Libya, a main jumping off point for migrants hoping to reach Europe. Meanwhile, Greece and the United Arab Emirates began joint air force training exercises in the eastern Mediterranean, in the latest build-up of military forces.
The training flights started Friday, a day after the UAE completed the transfer of nine F-16 fighter jets and four transport planes to a Greek airbase on the island of Crete, the Greek Defense Ministry said.
France, Italy, and the UAE have joined recent military exercises and training missions held by Greece and ally Cyprus, while the United States has also held separate exercises with Greece.

For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App.","BERLIN/BRUSSELS, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The European Union is preparing sanctions against Turkey that could be discussed at the bloc’s next summit on Sept. 24 in response to the eastern Mediterranean dispute with Greece, the EU’s top diplomat said on Friday. 
The measures, meant to limit Turkey’s ability to explore for natural gas in contested waters, could include individuals, ships or the use of European ports, Josep Borrell said. The EU would focus on everything related to “activities we consider illegal”, he added. 
He spoke in Berlin where EU foreign ministers met to discuss support for Greece after Athens ratified a pact on its maritime boundaries to counter Turkey’s claims to energy resources in the region amid Greek and Turkish military exercises. 
Borrell, who chaired the meeting, said the bloc was ready to sanction Turkish vessels, block their access to EU ports and cut off supplies. The EU could also impose sanctions on the Turkish economy. 
“We can go to measures related to sectoral activities ... where the Turkish economy is related to the European economy,” Borrell told a news conference, referring to possible sanctions. 
However, Borrell and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the EU first wanted to give dialogue a chance to cool tensions between Greece and Turkey, which are NATO allies. 
Turkey is also a formal candidate to join the EU, although its candidacy is also at risk and could be withdrawn as a type of sanction, diplomats have said. 
Two senior EU diplomats told Reuters that foreign ministers agreed to leave any decision to EU government leaders, who are set to meet for a two-day summit from Sept. 24. 
“Nothing will be decided before the September European Council,” a senior diplomat said, although the envoy added that Turkey could also be rewarded with greater access to the EU’s market of 450 million consumers if it curtailed its drilling. 
Greece and Turkey are at odds over the rights to potential hydrocarbon resources in the area, based on conflicting claims over the extent of their continental shelves. 
Tensions escalated this month after Ankara dispatched the Oruc Reis seismic survey vessel in a disputed area following the pact between Athens and Cairo.

796509,1,2,"Ministers from 6 Oppn states move SC, seek review of court’s nod for NEET, JEE exams","NEET, JEE: 6 states seek review of SC order","Six ministers from Maharashtra, Punjab, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh moved the Supreme Court on Friday and sought review of its August 17 order allowing conduct of NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) entrance examinations.
The plea referred to the rise in Covid-19 cases in the country and said that if the August 17 order is not reviewed, grave and irreparable harm and injury would befall on the student community. The petitioners said not only will health, welfare and safety of students/candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE examinations stand imperilled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy…
The petitioners are Moloy Ghatak (minister from West Bengal), Rameshwar Oraon (Jharkhand), Raghu Sharma (Rajasthan), Amarjeet Bhagat (Chhattisgarh), Balbir Singh Sidhu (Punjab), and Uday Ravindra Samant (Maharashtra).
The petition, filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes, stated that the National Testing Agency (NTA) had notified that NEET (UG) will be held on September 13 and JEE (Mains) from September 1-6.
The plea said that as per NTA, approximately 9.53 lakh and 15.97 lakh students have registered for JEE (Mains) and NEET (UG), respectively. This means 25 lakh students cumulatively would be appearing for these two examinations, the petition stated. As on 27th August, India has over 3.31 million [more than 33 lakh] Covid-19 cases. We are presently at the third position in this unenviable list after the US (5.79 million cases) and Brazil (3.72 million) and on course to be the No. 1 nation on this list.
While there are 660 examination centres for JEE roughly 1,443 students per centre there are 3,843 centres for NEET, or approximately 415 students per centre, the petitioners pointed out. Such large movement of people will ipso facto prove to be a serious health hazard and will totally defeat the twin present-day solutions we have of combating the Covid-19 i.e. social distancing and avoidance of large public gatherings, they said, urging the court to postpone the entrance examinations.

The plea said, Having at least one centre per district would have minimised the inter-district travel of students and thereby reduced chances of Covid-19 spread.
The petitioners said, The mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or willingness or desire to attend physical exams, as no student would like to forego the exam, if its conducted and the respondents are forcing the students to put their lives and health in peril by conducting these exams.
In a situation, the plea said, where there is absolutely no classroom teaching, the decision of the Union Government to conduct examinations on such a massive scale reveals non-application of mind and is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious exercise of power.
The petitioners said they do not wish to make any value judgment or political criticism of the Union Government in such times but the undisputed facts are that there has been an exponential increase in both Covid-19 positive cases as well as deaths/mortality arising out of Covid-19 from April, when these exams were originally scheduled, till August, when the Union Government decided to conduct the said examinations.
The Covid-19 graph is showing a continuous upward movement and the ‘curve’ has not flattened for the Government to undertake such a massive exercise, the petition stated. It said that schools and colleges continue to remain shut despite the various phases of unlock and there is no rational nexus between the object of the examinations and the purpose that it seeks to achieve.

The six ministers stated that the Centre had adequate time to make comprehensive preparations for safe and successful conduct of the examinations. However, they argued, the intervening months from April to September were characterised by inaction, confusion, lethargy and inertia…now the Union Government has suddenly woken up to realise that their inertia is going to cost lakhs of students their academic year and therefore as a knee-jerk reaction…has haphazardly and hurriedly fixed the dates of the examinations.
The petitioners called it a remedy that will prove to be worse than the disease itself.
The plea said that postponing the exams by two months would give valuable time to the government to put in place an adequate mechanism in consultation with the State Governments, to ensure a smoother and safer conduct of examinations.
The petition also pointed to health issues of students and said that even otherwise, with recent evidences and information of the virus being allegedly airborne now, conducting of physical examination of such magnitude can have disastrous consequences.

The petition said there have been instances where surge in cases have been reported after offline exams were conducted.
The process of reaching the examination centre itself can be a major source of contracting the infection, and candidates may become vectors carrying the virus to their homes, it said.
The petitioners said, The mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or willingness or desire to attend physical exams, as no student would like to forego the exam, if its conducted and the respondents are forcing the students to put their lives and health in peril by conducting these exams.
They said, If the Union Govt/NTA decides to hold the exams, then the students do not have an effective choice left but to register and appear for the exam at great personal risk.
Oppn parties slam Centre: Listen to students
After approaching the Supreme Court, four Opposition parties led by the Congress on Friday hit out at the BJP-led central government, accusing it of being stubborn about holding the NEET and JEE examinations.
Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the government has been incompetent. He and Congress president Sonia Gandhi asked the government to listen to students.
Please, listen to them. Have a conversation and resolve this issue peacefully, he said.
Addressing a joint press conference, Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren (JMM), Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O Brien and Maharashtra Higher Education Minister Uday Samant (Shiv Sena) slammed the Centre over the issue.

A Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra, on August 17, had dismissed pleas seeking deferment of JEE Main 2020 and NEET UG examinations which are slated to be held in September.
Pursuant to the August 17 order of the Apex Court, the National Testing Agency (NTA)- earlier this week- notified that the said entrance examination would be conducted as per the revised schedule with the NEET on September 13 and the JEE on September 16.
The review petitions now state the Supreme Courts judgment and the NTAs decision to conduct the said exams, in the midst of the pandemic, is ""flawed"".
The petitioners have contended that the said decision fails to ensure the safety, security and right to life of the student candidates appearing for the said exams.
The review petitions further state that the NTA has ignored the logistical difficulties in carrying the examinations on the proposed dates and also failed to balance the competing but equally crucial aspect of conducting the examination and safety of the students. The review petitioners have also raised the issue of lack of mandatory safeguards for carrying the examinations.
The review petitioners have stated that nearly 25 lakh students will appear for the examinations in the midst of the pandemic and at a time when the country has recorded over 3.31 million COVID-19 cases.
With JEE being proposed to be conducted in over 660 exam centres for 9.53 lakh students, roughly 1,443 students will be writing the exam per JEE centre and for the NEET UG exams, 15.97 lakh students are slated to appear in 3,843 centres, meaning that there will be 415 students per NEET exam centre, the pleas state.
The review petitions have been filed by the Cabinet Ministers of six states in their individual capacities.
These are Moloy Ghatak, Minister-in-Charge, Department of Labour &amp; E.S.I. (MB) Scheme and Departments of Law &amp; Judicial, West Bengal; Dr Rameshwar Oraon, Finance Minister, Jharkhand; Dr Raghu Sharma, Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Rajasthan; Amarjeet Bhagat, Indian Minister of Food, Civil supplies, Culture, Planning, Chhattisgarh; Balbir Singh Sidhu, Minister of Health and Family Welfare &amp; Labour, Punjab and Uday Ravindra Samant, Minister of Higher and Technical Education, Maharashtra.
Challenging the SC decision, the review petitioners have said that the Apex Court failed to appreciate that the Union Government had adequate time to establish at least one centre for every district for NEET (UG) and JEE (Mains) rather than having several centres in one district. Having at least one centre per district would have minimised the inter-district long travel of the students and thereby reduced the chances of COVID-19 spread.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/ministers-from-6-oppn-states-move-sc-seek-review-of-courts-nod-for-neet-jee-exams-6574240/,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/neet-jee-exams-ministers-of-6-opposition-ruled-states-move-sc-seek-review-of-order/articleshow/77801986.cms

The plea referred to the rise in Covid-19 cases in the country and said that if the August 17 order is not reviewed, grave and irreparable harm and injury would befall on the student community. The petitioners said not only will health, welfare and safety of students/candidates appearing for the NEET/JEE examinations stand imperilled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy…
The petitioners are Moloy Ghatak (minister from West Bengal), Rameshwar Oraon (Jharkhand), Raghu Sharma (Rajasthan), Amarjeet Bhagat (Chhattisgarh), Balbir Singh Sidhu (Punjab), and Uday Ravindra Samant (Maharashtra).
The petition, filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes, stated that the National Testing Agency (NTA) had notified that NEET (UG) will be held on September 13 and JEE (Mains) from September 1-6.
The plea said that as per NTA, approximately 9.53 lakh and 15.97 lakh students have registered for JEE (Mains) and NEET (UG), respectively. This means 25 lakh students cumulatively would be appearing for these two examinations, the petition stated. As on 27th August, India has over 3.31 million [more than 33 lakh] Covid-19 cases. We are presently at the third position in this unenviable list after the US (5.79 million cases) and Brazil (3.72 million) and on course to be the No. 1 nation on this list.
While there are 660 examination centres for JEE roughly 1,443 students per centre there are 3,843 centres for NEET, or approximately 415 students per centre, the petitioners pointed out. Such large movement of people will ipso facto prove to be a serious health hazard and will totally defeat the twin present-day solutions we have of combating the Covid-19 i.e. social distancing and avoidance of large public gatherings, they said, urging the court to postpone the entrance examinations.

The plea said, Having at least one centre per district would have minimised the inter-district travel of students and thereby reduced chances of Covid-19 spread.
The petitioners said, The mere fact that lakhs of students have registered for the exam is not indicative of their consent or willingness or desire to attend physical exams, as no student would like to forego the exam, if its conducted and the respondents are forcing the students to put their lives and health in peril by conducting these exams.
In a situation, the plea said, where there is absolutely no classroom teaching, the decision of the Union Government to conduct examinations on such a massive scale reveals non-application of mind and is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious exercise of power.
The petitioners said they do not wish to make any value judgment or political criticism of the Union Government in such times but the undisputed facts are that there has been an exponential increase in both Covid-19 positive cases as well as deaths/mortality arising out of Covid-19 from April, when these exams were originally scheduled, till August, when the Union Government decided to conduct the said examinations.
The Covid-19 graph is showing a continuous upward movement and the ‘curve’ has not flattened for the Government to undertake such a massive exercise, the petition stated. It said that schools and colleges continue to remain shut despite the various phases of unlock and there is no rational nexus between the object of the examinations and the purpose that it seeks to achieve.

The six ministers stated that the Centre had adequate time to make comprehensive preparations for safe and successful conduct of the examinations. However, they argued, the intervening months from April to September were characterised by inaction, confusion, lethargy and inertia…now the Union Government has suddenly woken up to realise that their inertia is going to cost lakhs of students their academic year and therefore as a knee-jerk reaction…has haphazardly and hurriedly fixed the dates of the examinations.
The petitioners called it a remedy that will prove to be worse than the disease itself.
The plea said that postponing the exams by two months would give valuable time to the government to put in place an adequate mechanism in consultation with the State Governments, to ensure a smoother and safer conduct of examinations.
The petition also pointed to health issues of students and said that even otherwise, with recent evidences and information of the virus being allegedly airborne now, conducting of physical examination of such magnitude can have disastrous consequences.

1817413,1,2,Movie Review: Sadak 2 - 2/5,Alia Bhatt shares stunning photo ahead of Sadak 2: ‘Keep your face towards the sunshine and the shadows... - Hindustan Times,"STORY: After her mother Shakuntala Desais death under mysterious circumstances, the Desai Group of Industries scion Aarya (Alia Bhatt) vows to avenge the murder and bring the culprits to justice. And, in order to honour her mothers last wish, Aarya embarks on a journey to Kailash and the story of Sadak 2 unfolds.REVIEW: Her entire family comprising the maasi-turned-step-mother Nandini Maa (Priyanka Bose) and father Yogesh (Jisshu Sengupta) is under the spell of dhongi sadhu Gyaan Prakash (Makarand Deshpande) but Aarya, all of 20, knows better. Utterly convinced that her beloved mother died owing to an elaborate plan hatched by Gyaan Prakash and that disease Nandini, Aarya launches an online campaign called India Fights Fake Gurus. Her motivation is to reveal the truth behind these supposed messengers of God and debunk the myth and mystery surrounding them. While treading along this mission, Aarya falls in love with a former troll a very good-looking musician with issues of his own, Vishal (Aditya Roy Kapur). Together, they embark on a pilgrimage to fulfil Aaryas maa-ka-aakhri-sapna of visiting Kailash on her 21st birthday.
However, there is a small hurdle the booking agent/ co-owner of Pooja Travels and Tours (that guarantees safety and security 24*7) is now dead and her taxi driver husband Ravis (Sanjay Dutt) only purpose in life is to reunite with her in Heaven. After much cajoling and persuasion, the heartbroken cabbie reluctantly says yes. Soon after, they find solace in each other and a unique friendship blossoms that is a win-win for both Aarya derives strength and hope from the lonely man and Ravi seeks a new purpose in life through this young girl driven to achieve what she is set out to do.
Back in the 90s, when Sadak, starring Sanjay Dutt and Pooja Bhatt, hit the theatres, it was such a rage among the audience; for two reasons: the incredible love ballads and its engaging plotline. 20 years on, Mahesh Bhatt conjures up a script to take that story on the road again. 
Sadak 2 starts off with a grim, almost melancholic setting, where the hopeless protagonist Ravi is tying a rope around his neck and talking to his deceased wife Pooja about their impending reunion in the afterlife. But the fan that he is hanging on to comes crashing down, and Ravi has to live another day. While listening to Hum Tere Bin Kahin Reh Nahin Paate (such nostalgia, much wow!) in his garage and planning yet another exit, his door bolts open and a hyper Aarya storms in demanding her three-month advance booking be honoured. Thus, begins a journey of random twists-and-turns, both on the road and off it, and a screenplay that goes down various routes and eventually hits a dead-end.
We dont know where to begin with: the dialogues are dated and over the top. Its been decades since we heard anyone in the movies say Jo garjte hai woh baraste nahi or Aadmi karz lauta sakta hain, ehsaan nahin. No matter what the logic is, co-writers Pushpdeep Bhardwaj, Mahesh Bhatt and Suhrita Sengupta could have done much better with the writing that is so passé. Now shifting focus to the set design and overall look-and-feel of the movie: the gundas wear flashy and eye-popping outfits, big wigs and enact dramatic knife-wielding scenes on camera topped with caricaturish action sequences. The background score by Sandeep Chowta deserves a special mention here and not for the right reasons its melodramatic and borderline annoying. 
Alia Bhatt, who is known for her fine performances on screen, falls flat this one time. Apart from a few emotional scenes, this act - by her own high standards - is strictly average. Aditya Roy Kapur doesnt have much role to play besides looking smoking hot and after a point, he appears aloof and even takes a back seat. Sanjay Dutt pulls off his emotional scenes quite well with those welled-up bulgy eyes doing all the talking. Even at this age, he sure knows how to bring off an action sequence taking down the baddies one by one. In a smaller role, Jisshu Sengupta as Alias daddy is impactful and he totally owns the few frames that he has in this action-drama. On the other hand, seasoned actors like Makarand Deshpande and Priyanka Bose deliver some unbelievably overblown acting. Their pseudo holy/ satanic act is hilarious to the core and quite frankly, at times we wonder whether to laugh or cry even during the emotionally-charged scenes. 
It is rather disappointing to see a filmmaker of Mahesh Bhatts stature to make a comeback as a director with Sadak 2. No offense but why this, Bhatt saab?
In a nutshell, Sadak 2, for everyone involved with this project, should have been a road not taken. And for those who are planning on watching this purely for sentimental reasons, be forewarned: This Sadak leads nowhere; turn back. Jai Guru ji!","Alia Bhatt has shared a new picture of herself from a picturesque location along with a thoughtful caption. The actor is currently looking forward to her upcoming film Sadak 2, which also stars Sanjay Dutt, Aditya Roy Kapur and Pooja Bhatt.
She captioned the picture, “Keep your face towards the sunshine and the shadows will fall behind you.” It shows Alia in an oversize white shrug while posing in front of a swimming pool amid nature. 
The actor seems to have taken a silent dig at trolls who have slammed her film amid nepotism debate. The trailer of the film has garnered 12 million views ever since its release on August 12. Director Mahesh Bhatt has also faced the heat over his June 8 chats with late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty.
Alia had earlier shared a similar post on her Instagram stories last month. She had shared a quote which read, “Silence says a lot more than you think.” While Alia remains silent on the issue, her sister Pooja Bhatt and mother Soni Razdan have been sharing their comments on social media. Pooja had said in one of her tweets, “Have been asked to comment on the hot topic Nepotism that people are raging about. As someone who hails from a ‘family’ that has launched more new talent - actors, musicians and technicians than the entire film industry combined, I can only laugh. Facts don’t find takers. Fiction does.”
Alia had recently announced that the full music album of Sadak 2 is out. There are a total of eight tracks in the album. The film that marks Mahesh Bhatt’s return to direction after 21 years continues from the plot of Sadak that was released in 1991 with Sanjay Dutt and Pooja Bhatt in the lead. Actors Jisshu Sengupta, Makarand Deshpande, Priyanka Bose, Mohan Kapur, Gulshan Grover and Akshay Anand also have prominent roles in the film. Sadak 2 is all set to release on the online video streaming platform Disney+ Hotstar on August 28.

(Photo: Disney)We haven’t had a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie for a long while. And The New Mutants does not fall under the MCU umbrella, but technically it is a Marvel movie, the last X-Men movie before Disney reboots the franchise now that it owns it along with most other Fox properties.
Based on the comic-book team of teenage mutants of the same name, The New Mutants stars Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Heaton, Alice Braga, Blu Hunt, and Henry Zaga. The movie was thought to be cursed by many film buffs due to half a dozen delays. And yet, it is here (in the US, anyway).
Sadly, the Josh Boone directorial has not impressed critics. It holds a rating of 25 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes, after 11 reviews.

The Hollywood Reporter’s Jordan Mintzer called it “generic” in his review. He added, “At its best, straining to be heartfelt, director Josh Boones adaptation of the Marvel spin-off comic series is a Marvel movie spinoff in its own right, making vague references to the X-Men franchise but attempting to stand on its own. Unfortunately it rarely does, even if the films trio of young and tough female leads manages to give your typically male-dominated genre something of a feminine twist.”
Globe and Mail’s Barry Hertz wrote, “It is difficult to pinpoint exactly where Boone goes wrong, because there are just so many options to choose from.”
JoBlo’s Movie Network’s Chris Bumbray opined, ” The brutal fact is no one would have wanted to sit through it. Its a pretty bad film, utterly devoid of the charm and imagination thats made Josh Boone such an up and coming director. Listening to him talk about the film, you can tell there was a lot of passion there, but the movie simply doesnt work. All they can hope for is a quick box office death and to move on.”
Blu-ray.com’s Brian Orndorf noted, “A plodding viewing experience, even with lowered expectations. It’s a better fit for television, as Boone is making a network pilot, not a big screen experience.”

For all the latest Entertainment News, download Indian Express App.","Three years after it was shot, the X-Men spin-off New Mutants was released to timid buzz and rotten reviews on Friday. There was a point during its production, however, that 20th Century Fox was so disappointed in the film that the studio was contemplating restarting from scratch.
A report by Vulture takes us into the troubled production, which serves as the final X-Men film from Fox, after its takeover by Disney. “Once principal photography was finished, Fox was so displeased with the initial cut the studio discussed throwing the entire movie out to ‘start over’ with a total reshoot,” the report says. “It was understood this was going to be X-Men at a price,” the report quotes a source as saying. “Deadpool had come out and was such a hit. It was sort of like, ‘What would an X-Men movie look like if it was hard-R, broke down some walls, was kind of meta, but it was also like a teen-horror flick with a John Hughes sensibility?’”
Director Josh Boone’s pitch frequently left executives scratching their heads. An early draft of the script subverted famous characters. “She was their sadistic jailer,” said one source about Storm. “It felt like the kids were being tortured. If the X-Men are holding [the young mutants] there, it can’t feel different from the mental furniture that audiences bring into the theatre knowing that the X-Men are good guys. Storm like that made no sense.”
To course correct a project that the studio sensed was going off the rails, it hired everyone from Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber -- the writers of Boone’s previous film, The Fault in Our Stars -- and Chad Hayes and Corey Hayes, the writers of The Conjuring. Boone continued to reject new suggestions. “There was this pattern where it would be Josh, then someone. Then Josh, then someone. Then Josh. That went back and forth,” the source said.

Boone and the studio have gone on record to say that no reshoots were held on the film. He told EW, “I’ll tell you this: If there hadn’t been a merger, I’m sure we would’ve done reshoots the same way every movie does pickups. We didn’t even do that, because by the time the merger was done and everything was settled, everybody’s older.”
But the studio wasn’t pleased with the film. “You could throw the movie out, start over, and it would still be the least expensive X-Men movie so far,” three sources recalled a high-ranking executive as saying. The film, starring Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Heaton and others was not screened for the press in the US, and currently sits at a 22% on Rotten Tomatoes.

1381825,1,2,US election: Donald Trump assails rival Joe Biden in acceptance speech,"Republicans rally behind Trump, say Biden no longer has any principles","WASHINGTON: A defiant President Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination for a second term on Thursday with a scathing attack on rival Joe Biden, asserting that a Democratic victory in November would only exacerbate the racial strife and coronavirus pandemic besieging the nation.
Speaking from the White House South Lawn despite criticism he was using the executive residence as a political prop, Trump portrayed Biden, a career politician with a long record as a moderate, as a far-left extremist who would usher in a lawless, dangerous America.
This election will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans, or whether we give free rein to violent anarchic agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens, Trump said on the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention in a speech that lasted more than an hour.
No one will be safe in Bidens America.
Despite the pandemic that has killed more than 180,000 Americans, Trump delivered his remarks before a crowd of more than 1,000 people, standing in front of dozens of American flags and basking in chants of Four more years! and U.S.A.!
His language was evocative of his 2016 convention acceptance speech, which also came at a time of racial tension after eight police officers were killed in Texas and Louisiana amid protests following shootings of Black men.
Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities, he said then, vowing to end the turmoil.
But Trump, who ran successfully as an insurgent four years ago, is now in control at the White House, complicating his assertion once again that only he can solve the problem.
As the night unfolded, Biden struck back on Twitter, writing, When Donald Trump says tonight you wont be safe in Joe Biden's America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trumps America?
In trying to paint Biden as a tool of the radical left, Trump also distorted the Democrats policy positions on a host of other issues, including immigration, guns, law enforcement, abortion and energy production.
If given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness, Trump warned.
Following the speech, fireworks exploded over the nearby Washington Monument as the president and his family looked on, giving Trump and the convention a powerful closing image.
The crowd, seated in white chairs inches apart, showed little evidence of social distancing or face masks despite health experts recommendations. But the Trump campaign said it had taken appropriate health precautions in arranging the South Lawn event.
In a reminder of the countrys divisions, attendees could hear anti-Trump protesters sounding horns near the White House as he spoke, a noise that occasionally was audible on the live broadcast.
Shifting BlameIn his speech on Thursday, Trump again blamed China for the pandemic and promised in his second term to levy tariffs on any company that left America to create jobs overseas, one of the rare concrete policy proposals of the night.
He also promised to rebuild what Republicans have called the greatest economy in history and attacked Biden for saying he would shut down the country if necessary to slow the spread of the disease. Many health experts blame a resurgence of coronavirus cases on states that reopened businesses too soon.
Joe Bidens plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather a surrender, Trump said.","Top Republican party leaders Thursday night rallied behind President Donald Trump as they used the platform of Republican National Convention to launch a blistering attack on his Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden.
""The Democrats are urging you to vote for an obviously defective candidate. Biden has changed his principles so often, he no longer has any principles, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said in his address to the Republican National Convention before Trump delivered his acceptance speech from the South Lawns of the White House.
""He's a Trojan Horse with Bernie (Sanders), AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), (Nancy) Pelosi, Black Lives Matter and his party's entire Left Wing hidden inside his body just waiting to execute their pro-criminal, anti-police policies, said the former New York City Mayor.
The whole unprecedented wave of lawlessness began with a truly just cause -- the unforgiveable police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Peaceful protests began all over the land. The condemnation of the killing was universal from President Trump to Democrat leaders, he said.
It seemed for a a few brief shining moments' like Democrat and Republican leaders would come together with a unified proposal to reduce police misconduct. This possibility was very dangerous to the Left, Giuliani said.
Biden and his fellow Democrats were widely criticized for not speaking up about the out-of-control violence plaguing Democrat cities in our country. Their silence was so deafening that it reveals an acceptance of this violence because they will accept anything they hope will defeat President Donald Trump, he said.
However, they are making this election a choice between the Democrat policies soft on crime against the Republican program of law and order. It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city, town or suburb, Giuliani said.
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said Joe Biden and Kamala Harris think this election is about the government. They're wrong. It's about you, not us. Your family and your future, he said.
Congressman Jeff Van Drew said that Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running the Democratic Party. the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president, he said.
Debbie Flood, the owner of a Wisconsin machine shop, alleged that Biden voted to normalize trade with China and helped pave the way for them to join the WTO, even though they were hurting American companies like hers.
Our President understands that the best solutions unleash the innovation of American entrepreneurs and the creativity of American workers. Joe Biden doesn't know anything about business. Or about creating jobs, she said.
He's spent 47 years in government. It is doubtful that he'll finally figure it out in year 48. He's pledged to raise our taxes and bring back excessive regulation, Flood said.
US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson said that Trump is the most pro-life President in our country's history. He will continue to fight for those who cannot yet speak, he said.
Our President, Donald J. Trump, believes in the people. He is one of us. He makes promises, and he keeps them. He is transparent, and we certainly know what he's thinking. He does not submit to political correctness or to its enforcers, the media. He is real, Carson said.
Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch said, ""You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America. You can have four more years of President Trump.""
Joe Biden won't stand up for America. Donald Trump will. So this November, let's stand with the president and vote to keep America great, Giuliani said.

Such exercises also violate China's commitments under the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea to avoid activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability, and call into question its motivations with ongoing negotiations for a Code of Conduct between China and ASEAN, the Pentagon said.
This military exercise, the Pentagon said, is the latest in a long string of Chinese actions to assert unlawful maritime claims and disadvantage its Southeast Asian neighbors in the South China Sea.
Chinese actions stand in contrast to its pledge to not militarise the South China Sea and are in contrast to the US vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, in which all nations, large and small, are secure in their sovereignty, free from coercion, and able to pursue economic growth consistent with accepted international rules and norms.
The Pentagon said that it alerted China in July that it would continue to monitor the situation with the expectation that China will reduce its militarisation and coercion of its neighbors in the South China Sea.
China chose to escalate its exercise activities by firing ballistic missiles, it said and urged all parties to exercise restraint and not undertake military activities that could threaten freedom of navigation and aggravate disputes in the South China Sea.
The Pentagon also announced to deploy Task Force Ellis, comprising US Marines and Sailors from I Marine Expeditionary Force, aboard the USS Comstock to the Indo-Pacific to conduct theater security cooperation activities through November 2020.
Task Force Ellis is designed to provide a forward-deployed capability to respond to a variety of crises and contingencies throughout the region, to include supporting Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR) operations, it said.
According to a media release, the Task Force also stands ready to conduct military-to-military training, subject matter expert exchanges, and key leader engagements.
The Task Force is comprised approximately 120 US Marines and Sailors from 1st Marine Division, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, 1st Marine Logistics Group, I MEF Information Group, and 1st Reconnaissance Battalion.
Task Force Ellis is forward-deployed with a wide range of capabilities to highlight the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, the Pentagon said.","China has escalated its previously announced exercise activities in the South China Sea by launching four medium-range missiles impacting the stretch between Hainan Island and the Paracel Islands, the Pentagon said Thursday.

4071807,1,3,Trump has shown reckless disregard for wellbeing of citizens: Kamala Harris,Trump has shown reckless disregard for well-being of American people: Kamala Harris,"Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's vice-presidential candidate, has blasted President Donald Trump for failing to protect the American people from the deadly coronavirus pandemic by being ""fixated on the stock market"" and caving in to China.
In a blistering speech hours before Trump delivered his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention from the South Lawn at the White House, Harris alleged that the president's policies have been ""a reckless disregard"" for the danger a pandemic would pose to American lives.
""Donald Trump has failed at the most basic and important job of a President of the United States. He failed to protect the American people. Plain and simple. Trump showed what we, in the legal profession, would call a reckless disregard for the well-being of the American people,"" Harris said.
With the Republican leaders attending the four-day convention largely downplaying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed over 180,000 people and infected over five million others in the US, Harris pointed out that Trump's failure to address the health emergency more aggressively is emblematic of a tweet-driven presidency.
""Here's what you have to understand about the nature of a pandemic: It's relentless. You can't stop it with the tweet,"" the 55-year-old Senator from California told Trump.
Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Trump froze and was scared. And he was petty and vindictive, she said.
She said Trump ""doesn't understand the presidency"" and believes it is ""all about him.""
The Republican convention is designed for one purpose: To soothe the president's Trump's ego, to make him feel good, Harris said.
""But here's the thing: He's the President of the United States, and it's not supposed to be about him. It's supposed to be about the health and the safety and the well-being of the American people.""
""And on that measure,"" she added, ""Donald Trump has failed.""""He never appreciated that a President swears an oath before God and country to protect America against threats seen and unseen. It's his duty. It's his obligation to protect us. And yet, he has failed. Miserably, she said.
Harris alleged that Trump ""caved"" in when the US needed him to be tough on the Chinese government.
""On January 24th, he praised the transparency of the Chinese government. He said, quote, China has been working hard to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.
""But they weren't being transparent. They blocked public health inspectors from the CDC, from getting the access and information they needed to protect American lives, she said, referring to China not allowing American health experts to visit Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus pandemic emerged last year before it spread across the world.
""Donald Trump stood idly by. And folks, it was a deadly decision. Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Donald Trump froze. He was scared. He was petty and vindictive, Harris said.
She said Trump was ""fixated on the stock market"" as he thought that shutting down the economic activities to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the country would harm his interests.
Former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate Harris from the Democratic Party are challenging President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence from the Republican Party in the November 3 presidential election.
""Here's the thing, Donald Trump's incompetence is nothing new. That has always been on full display. But in January of this year, it became deadly. That's when the threat of a virus that would endanger the world first emerged. Trump dismissed the threat. Joe Biden sounded the alarm, she said.
It would be the beginning of a pattern that persists to this day. Trump telling us not to worry, that the virus will, quote, disappear, that a quote, miracle is coming. Joe Biden, saying we need a plan, a national strategy, a President who is willing to lead, willing to be a role model for our nation. For our children, Harris said.
This was the first major policy attack by Harris against Trump after she was nominated by the Democratic Party as its vice-presidential candidate last week, becoming the first Indian-American and first Black woman to be picked by a major American political party for the top post.
As President, Joe Biden will put a plan into effect on day one, she asserted. Develop and deploy rapid tests with immediate results. Make sure testing, treatments, and ultimately, a vaccine reach all Americans, including communities of color, who have historically been left behind. Manufacture the medical supplies and protective equipment we need, she said.
And make them right here-in America, so we're never again at the mercy of China and other foreign countries to protect our own people, she added. A Biden Administration will put in place a nationwide mask Mandate-it's not a burden to protect each other.
Harris alleged that before the virus hit, Trump made the country vulnerable. After it was struck, he failed to do what was necessary. As it continues, he's making it worse every day, she said.

This was the first major policy attack by Harris against Trump after she was nominated by the Democratic Party as its vice-presidential candidate last week.Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic Party’s vice-presidential candidate, on Thursday blasted President Donald Trump for having “failed” in and “shown reckless disregard” for the well-being of the American people.
“Donald Trump has failed at the most basic and important job of a President of the United States. He failed to protect the American people. Plain and simple. Trump showed what we, in the legal profession, would call a reckless disregard for the well-being of the American people”, Harris said.
In a blistering speech hours before Trump was to the deliver his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention, Harris alleged that the president’s policies have been “a reckless disregard” for the danger a pandemic would pose to American lives.
“For the devastation it would do to our economy. For the damage it would do to communities of color who have been subjected to structural racism for generations. For the chaos that would upend our daily lives, make it impossible for many of our kids to go to school, make it impossible to live normally and with certainty”, she said.
“He never appreciated that a President swears an oath before God and country to protect America against threats seen and unseen. It’s his duty. It’s his obligation to protect us. And yet, he has failed. Miserably”, she said.
“Here’s the thing, Donald Trump’s incompetence is nothing new. That has always been on full display. But in January of this year, it became deadly. That’s when the threat of a virus that would endanger the world first emerged. Trump dismissed the threat. Joe Biden sounded the alarm”, she said.

Joe Biden, saying we need a plan, a national strategy, a President who is willing to lead, willing to be a role model for our nation. For our children”, Harris said.
There was no immediate reaction from the president. He was scheduled to deliver his address to Republican National Convention.

7804546,1,3,"Hurricane Laura makes landfall in US; 4 killed, extensive damage to property","Hurricane Laura makes landfall in US; 4 killed, extensive property damage","Hurricane Laura made landfall near Cameron in Louisiana on Thursday, bringing ""catastrophic storm surge, extreme winds and flash flooding"" that killed at least four people, caused extensive damage to property and snapped electricity supply. Laura, a category 4 hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 150 miles per hour and one of the strongest to hit the US, slammed the Gulf Coast early Thursday and roared through Louisiana. The bulk of the damage was reported in Louisiana. The storm barreled over Lake Charles, Louisiana, an industrial and casino city of 80,000 people. 
President Donald Trump is expected to visit the Gulf Coast this weekend to survey the destruction caused by one of the catastrophic hurricanes in living memory here. Speaking at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters, hours before the final night of the Republican National Convention, Trump said the campaign briefly considered postponing his convention speech until Monday so he could travel to Texas, Louisiana and possibly Arkansas to survey the damage, but ultimately decided to continue with the speech as planned. 
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were briefed in detail along with damage pictures by FEMA officials at its National Response Coordination Center. 
""This team forward deployed resources,"" Pence said. ""We were ready for the worst, and by all accounts from the experts, while this was obviously a major storm with devastating impact, it was not as bad as it could have been."" 
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told Trump that the situation on the ground ""is fluid and challenging,"" but the FEMA is responding. The hurricane's top wind speed of 150 mph put it among the most powerful on record in the US. 
At least four deaths have been linked to the storm in Louisiana, Governor John Bel Edwards said Thursday. All of the victims died when trees fell on their homes. One victim was a 14-year-old girl in Vernon Parish. The other three are a 68-year-old man in Acadia Parish, a 51-year-old man in Jackson Parish, and a 64-year-old woman in Allen Parish. 
Widespread power outages across Louisiana and Texas are increasing and as of 4 p.m. CST more than 8,40,000 people remained without power, according to data from PowerOutage.us. Louisiana is experiencing the worst of the outages with almost 6,00,000 people without electricity. 
Videos shared on social media showed that wind blew out dozens of windows in high-rise office buildings, including the 22-story CapitalOne tower, ripped the top off a sky bridge, and tipped an R.V. on its side. The whistling winds mimicked the alarm-like sounds that could be heard inside buildings, according to videos on social media. 
Laura damaged key transmission lines, conductors and some transmission towers that handle bringing power from the east. KHOU-TV said that the power utility is asking customers in the western area north of Houston to voluntarily curtail their power usage to help the infrastructure. 
In Lake Charles, a regional hub known for its petrochemical plants and crowded casinos, commercial buildings were peeled apart, exposing insulation and wood frames. Billboards were punched out and trees snapped in half. 
Fire broke out Thursday morning at a chemical plant in Westlake, local authorities said, sending thick smoke over a wide area and prompting shelter-in-place directives for residents in the communities of Westlake, Moss Bluff and Sulphur. 
Mayor Robert Hardey of Westlake said the fire was burning at a plant operated by BioLab, a subsidiary of Kik Custom Products, which makes cleaners, antifreeze and other chemical products. A spokesman for the parent company, confirmed in a statement that the fire was the result of storm damage. 
Meanwhile, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Thursday that his state dodged a bullet. He said there were still no confirmed fatalities in Texas nearly 12 hours after Laura made landfall and his state appeared to have made it through the storm with minimal or no loss of life, which he said was a ""miracle."" 
Abbott toured the affected areas of East Texas Thursday and described seeing roofs sheared off buildings and uprooted trees following an aerial tour of the damage near their shared border. 
Abbott said about 8,500 people were served in Texas shelters. He said the state minimized potential loss of life because residents in the storm's path heeded local advance warnings to evacuate. 
Hurricane Laura made landfall overnight near Cameron, Louisiana, bringing ""catastrophic storm surge, extreme winds and flash flooding"" to portions of the state, the National Hurricane Center said Thursday. The storm had intensified rapidly into a Category 4 hurricane before slamming into the Gulf Coast near the Louisiana-Texas border. 
By mid-Thursday, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm as it moved north over Louisiana, which took the brunt of the damage. It was continuing to bring strong winds and flooding rainfall to northern Louisiana and southeastern Arkansas, according to forecasters. 
High water levels were persisting along the Gulf Coast. Tornadoes are possible through Thursday night in parts of Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi.","Hurricane Laura made landfall near Cameron in Louisiana on Thursday, bringing ""catastrophic storm surge, extreme winds and flash flooding"" that killed at least four people, caused extensive damage to property and snapped electricity supply.

US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 16 cents, or 0.4 per cent, to $42.85 a barrel as of 0014 GMT, adding to overnight losses.
Brent crude futures for October, set to expire on Friday, fell 9 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $45.00 a barrel, while the more active November contract slipped 7 cents to $45.53.
Hurricane Laura hit Louisiana early Thursday with 150 mile-per-hour (240 kph) winds, damaging buildings, knocking down trees and cutting power to more than 650,000 people in Louisiana and Texas, but refineries were spared from feared massive flooding.
""Unless there is any lasting damage to oil production infrastructure, it would not be a surprise to see oil trade down a bit after the storm as damage assessment continues,"" AxiCorp market strategist Stephen Innes said in a note.
US producers had shut 1.56 million barrels per day of crude output, or 83 per cent of the Gulf of Mexico's production, while nine refineries had shut around 2.9 million bpd of capacity, or 15 per cent of US processing capacity, ahead of the storm.
Late on Thursday, the Port of Houston, the top US crude oil export hub accounting for about 600,000 barrels per day of shipments, was in the process of reopening to commercial shipping late Thursday.

The Knight Riders reached the halfway mark of the league stage with a perfect record of five wins in five matches as they outplayed Guyana Amazon Warriors by seven wickets with a fine all-round display.
Sent into bat, the Warriors posted a lowly 112 for 7. The Knight Riders then overhauled the target, scoring 115 for 3 with 10 balls to spare.
Trinbago got an early break when Sikandar Raza clean bowled Brandon King (6) in the second over of the innings. Khary Pierre then struck twice in one over, dismissing Chandrapaul Hemraj (2) and Nicholas Pooran (1) to leave Amazon Warriors at 12 for 3.

After 10 overs, the Knight Riders were 51 for two but soon Tion Webster was sent back by Chris Green. Yet they stayed on the course and needed 35 off the last 36 balls.
Tahir and Keemo Paul bowled well and put some pressure but Bravo cleared the ropes off a Naveen full toss and Tim Seifert (39) smashed the first ball of Tahir’s last over for six.

Zouks’ captain Daren Sammy put Patriots in to bat and before they had scored Nabi dismissed both Chris Lynn and Nick Kelly off the third and fifth deliveries. 
Coming back in the third over of the innings, Nabi had another twin-strike as Denesh Ramdin top-edged to Najibullah Zadran and off the next ball Patriots’ leading scorer Evin Lewis, spooned a sweep to Roston Chase.

An employee packs goods into a plastic bag at a checkout counter of a Big Bazaar hypermarket, operated by Future Retail Ltd, in Mumbai, India, on Sunday, April 16, 2017. (Photographer: Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg)India’s Future Enterprises Ltd is all set to finalise the sale of the group’s retail business to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd’s retail arm on Saturday, The Economic Times said.
The deal, reportedly in the works for months now, has been valued at about 290-300 billion rupees ($3.92-$4.06 billion), according to various media reports. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, The Economic Times said on Friday that Reliance will take on Future Group’s debt and liabilities and pick up a minority stake in its consumer arm.
Owned by India’s “father of modern retailing”, Kishore Biyani, Future Group is home to supermarket chain Big Bazaar, upmarket food stores Foodhall, and bargain clothing chain Brand Factory.
The Group will merge five listed units across grocery, apparel, supply chain and the consumer business into Future Enterprises, which will then hive off all retail assets and sell them to Reliance as a single unit, the report said.
Future Group and Reliance did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for a comment.
Future Enterprises had said earlier this week it would meet on Saturday to consider proposals to raise funds through an issue of bonds.
Led by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, Reliance has been diversifying its business and ramping up a retail presence. It launched an online grocery service JioMart in May, a move rivalling Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc Ltd’s Flipkart in India, a key growth market for e-commerce.
The company is also in talks to buy online furniture company Urban Ladder and milk delivery startup Milkbasket to strengthen its e-commerce business, The Times of India had said earlier this month.
Shares in Future Enterprises Ltd jumped 5% and hit an upper price limit.

2315080,1,3,Here's why Wall Street thinks Walmart's move to buy TikTok makes sense,"Walmart wants to go viral with TikTok, Wall Street thinks it can","Wall Street was swift to see the rationale behind Walmart Inc jumping into the fray to buy TikTok - access to millions of young, digitally savvy users who could help the 60-year-old company boost its online sales.
The retailer revealed plans to join Microsoft Corp in a bid for the social media firm's US assets on Thursday, hours after the video company's chief executive said he would step down.
Analysts said Walmart picking up a stake in the short-form video app, which is owned by China's ByteDance and claims to have about 100 million active monthly users in the United States, could be a game changer for the world's largest retailer.

About 23% of US users reported making a purchase on Instagram earlier this year, compared to just 15% in late-2019, according to a survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets.

7132156,1,3,"Joe Biden will be destroyer of American greatness, says Donald Trump",Joe Biden's victory will endanger nation and destroy American greatness: Donald Trump,"Seeking another four years in the White House, US President Donald Trump has slammed Democratic rival Joe Biden's record as a ""shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals"" and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness.
Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration.
Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: Joe Biden is not the saviour of America's soul.""
He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness.""
Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history, Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election.
Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs, Trump alleged.
During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered.
This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas, he said.
This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades, he said.
Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens.
And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it, he said.
Referring to the last week's Democrat National Convention, Trump said that Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice.
So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country? he asked.
In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history, he said.
Trump alleged that for 47 years, Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands.
Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, he alleged.
Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defence, he said.
Trump alleged that as vice president Biden supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry.
He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing (Qasem) Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as ""a positive development"" for America and the world. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win, he said.

2303481,1,3,Sushant Singh Rajput case: Press Council asks media not to carry out its own ‘parallel trial’,PCI asks media not to carry out its own trial,"By: PTI | New Delhi | 
Updated: August 28, 2020 9:20:28 pm
Sushant Singh Rajput was found hanging on June 14 in his flat in suburban Bandra.Taking strong objection to the coverage of the Sushant Singh Rajput case by many media outlets, the Press Council of India on Friday said the media should adhere to the norms of journalistic conduct in covering cases under investigation and is advised not to carry out its own “parallel trial”.
The media should not narrate the story in a manner so as to induce the general public to believe in the complicity of the person indicted, the Press Council of India (PCI) said in its advisory.
The Council said it has noted with “distress that coverage of the alleged suicide by a film actor by many media outlets is in violation of the norms of journalistic conduct” and, therefore, advises the media to adhere to the norms framed by it.
Asserting that publishing information based on gossip about the line of investigation by official agencies on the crime committed is not desirable, the PCI said it is not advisable to vigorously report crime related issues on a “day to day basis and comment on the evidence without ascertaining the factual matrix”.

Such reporting brings undue pressure in the course of fair investigation and trial, it said.
“The media is advised to refrain from giving excessive publicity to the victim, witnesses, suspects and accused as it will amount to invasion of their privacy rights,” the PCI said.
Identification of the witnesses by the media needs to be avoided as it endangers them to come under pressure from the accused or associates as well as investigating agencies, it said.
The PCI asserted that the media is advised not to “conduct its own parallel trial or foretell the decision to avoid pressure during investigation and trial”.

The reporting of the alleged suicide by the actor by some of newspapers is also in violation of the norms formulated by the Council for reporting on suicide, it said.
The norm prohibits publishing stories about suicide prominently and advises the media not to unduly repeat such stories, the PCI said.
The media is expected not to use language which sensationalises or normalises suicides or presents it as a constructive solution to the problems, it said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday as a massive storm raced inland past the heart of the U.S. oil industry in Louisiana and Texas without causing any widespread damage to refineries.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 3 cents, or 0.1%, to $43.01 a barrel as of 0409 GMT.
WTI is on track to rise 1.6% rise this week, for a fourth straight week of gains.
Brent crude futures for October, set to expire on Friday, rose 2 cents to $45.11 a barrel, heading for a 1.7% weekly gain. The more active November contract climbed 3 cents to $45.63.
""With the U.S. Gulf hurricanes out of the way and preliminary assessment showing no damage to the upstream or downstream facilities, crude has surrendered most of the storm premium and could enter a holding pattern again,"" said Vandana Hari, oil market analyst at Vanda Insights.
Hurricane Laura hit Louisiana early Thursday with winds of 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour), damaging buildings, knocking down trees and cutting power to more than 650,000 people in Louisiana and Texas, but refineries were spared from feared massive flooding.
But investors are shifting their concerns from production outages to demand destruction, analysts said.
""Crude prices have barely budged this week, but refining margins have been hammered as flash floods disrupt normal consumption patterns, likely for a longer period of time than (Gulf of Mexico) production remains offline,"" said RBC Capital in a note.
U.S. producers had shut 1.56 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude output, or 83% of the Gulf of Mexico's production, while nine refineries had shut around 2.9 million bpd of capacity, or 15% of U.S. processing capacity, ahead of the storm.
Late on Thursday, the Port of Houston, the top U.S. crude oil export hub accounting for about 600,000 bpd of shipments, was in the process of reopening to commercial shipping late Thursday.
The earlier closures of Houston Port, Beaumont and Port Arthur were expected to reduce seaborne crude export capacity by nearly 1 million bpd, data intelligence firm Kpler estimated, based on average figures over the past four months.
In refining, Motiva Enterprises is preparing to restart its 607,000 bpd refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, the largest in the U.S., on Friday and Exxon Mobil Corp was preparing to restart units at its 369,024 bpd Beaumont, Texas refinery.

FUNDAMENTALS 
Spot gold was up 0.1% at $1,929.94 per ounce by 0117 GMT, after falling more than 1.2% on Thursday. Gold has fallen more than 0.5% so far this week. 
U.S. gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,936.30. 
The Fed’s new monetary policy strategy pledges to address “shortfalls” from the “broad-based and inclusive goal” of full employment and also promises to aim for 2% inflation on average. 
Longer-term U.S. Treasury yields climbed to their highest levels in months on Thursday. Higher bond yields increase the opportunity cost of holding non-interest bearing gold. 
Meanwhile, the dollar index rose 0.1% against a basket of major currencies. 
Asian equities are likely to have a bumpy ride on Friday after U.S. stocks scaled new peaks for a third straight session. 
More than 24.33 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 826,948 have died, according to a Reuters tally. 
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits hovered around 1 million last week, suggesting the labour market recovery was stalling as the COVID-19 pandemic drags. 
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said after talks with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on Thursday that Democrats and Republicans remained far apart over how much to spend on the next coronavirus relief legislation.

4948640,1,3,Dream of flying car could get real as Japan successfully conducts test flight with person aboard,"Japan's 'flying car' carries out successful test run, with a person aboard","The decades-old dream of zipping around in the sky as simply as driving on highways may be becoming less illusory.
Japan's SkyDrive Inc., among the myriads of ``flying car'' projects around the world, has carried out a successful though modest test flight with one person aboard.
In a video shown to reporters on Friday, a contraption that looked like a slick motorcycle with propellers lifted several feet (1-2 meters) off the ground, and hovered in a netted area for four minutes.
Tomohiro Fukuzawa, who heads the SkyDrive effort, said he hopes ``the flying car'' can be made into a real-life product by 2023, but he acknowledged that making it safe was critical.
``Of the world's more than 100 flying car projects, only a handful has succeeded with a person on board,'' he told The Associated Press.
``I hope many people will want to ride it and feel safe.''
The machine so far can fly for just five to 10 minutes but if that can become 30 minutes, it will have more potential, including exports to places like China, Fukuzawa said.
Unlike airplanes and helicopters, eVTOL, or ``electric vertical takeoff and landing,'' vehicles offer quick point-to-point personal travel, at least in principle.
They could do away with the hassle of airports and traffic jams and the cost of hiring pilots, they could fly automatically.
Battery sizes, air traffic control and other infrastructure issues are among the many potential challenges to commercializing them.
``Many things have to happen,'' said Sanjiv Singh, professor at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, who co-founded Near Earth Autonomy, near Pittsburgh, which is also working on an eVTOL aircraft.
``If they cost $10 million, no one is going to buy them. If they fly for 5 minutes, no one is going to buy them. If they fall out of the sky every so often, no one is going to buy them,'' Singh said in a telephone interview.
The SkyDrive project began humbly as a volunteer project called Cartivator in 2012, with funding by top Japanese companies including automaker Toyota Motor Corp., electronics company Panasonic Corp. and video-game developer Bandai Namco.
A demonstration flight three years ago went poorly. But it has improved and the project recently received another round of funding, of 3.9 billion yen ($37 million), including from the Development Bank of Japan.
The Japanese government is bullish on ``the Jetsons'' vision, with a ``road map'' for business services by 2023, and expanded commercial use by the 2030s, stressing its potential for connecting remote areas and providing lifelines in disasters.
Experts compare the buzz over flying cars to the days when the aviation industry got started with the Wright Brothers and the auto industry with the Ford Model T.
Lilium of Germany, Joby Aviation in California and Wisk, a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Kitty Hawk Corp., are also working on eVTOL projects.
Sebastian Thrun, chief executive of Kitty Hawk, said it took time for airplanes, cell phones and self-driving cars to win acceptance.

4257340,1,3,"Legal hurdles, pandemic would bedevil Biden efforts to undo Trump immigration overhaul - Reuters","Theatrics aside, Kamala Harris will help build on Donald Trump’s India policy - Livemint","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he will reverse some of President Donald Trump’s restrictive immigration policies should he win in November, but the dizzying number of changes could take months or years to undo, according to policy and regulatory experts and people close to the Biden campaign. 
They said Biden’s efforts also would be slowed by legal hurdles, political pressure to keep some measures, and a crowded agenda at the beginning of a presidency dominated by the novel coronavirus pandemic. 
“There are going to be a number of urgent matters that require immediate action, including dealing with a global pandemic that has taken hundreds of thousands of lives, including dealing with an economy that is in shambles, all due to President Trump’s failed leadership,” senior Biden campaign adviser Cristóbal Alex said. 
He said Biden was committed to reversing what he called Trump’s “horrific” immigration policies. 
Trump, carrying out a pledge of his “America First” 2016 campaign to reduce legal and illegal immigration, ordered travel bans, hardened efforts to deter Central American migrants entering at the U.S.-Mexico border and made it more difficult for people to obtain refugee status. His administration has blocked immigrants and temporary foreign workers from the United States, saying the moves were needed to preserve jobs for Americans as unemployment soared during coronavirus-related shutdowns. 
Some of the Republican president’s most far-reaching policies have been issued during the pandemic, including blocking many travelers from China, Iran, Europe and Brazil, and suspending non-essential travel across the borders with Canada and Mexico. 
While Biden has criticized some of these restrictions, he has not said if he would immediately reverse them. He has also not commented on emergency border rules implemented in March that allow U.S. authorities to rapidly expel border crossers, including unaccompanied children and asylum seekers. 
Julie Chávez Rodríguez, another senior adviser to the Biden campaign, said he would look to public health officials for guidance on pandemic-related border closures and accused Trump of trying to “scapegoat” immigrants with the restrictions on legal immigration. 
Some of Trump’s executive actions will be relatively easy to undo with the stroke of a pen. But finalized regulations that have gone through a period of public review typically take anywhere from several months to a year to unravel, and could take longer, according to four regulatory experts. Lawsuits could delay attempts to undo Trump regulations and smaller-scale memos and guidance issued to agencies. 
These logistical obstacles mean that Trump’s immigration legacy could endure well beyond his presidency, according to the policy experts, outside Biden campaign advisers and current and former Trump officials. Immigrant advocates who are hoping for faster change would likely be disappointed. 
`BREATHTAKING` 
The architect of Trump’s sweeping immigration agenda, senior adviser Stephen Miller, called the scope of the changes to the U.S. immigration system over the past 3-1/2 years “breathtaking” and “without precedent” - a description echoed by both Trump backers and opponents. 
Miller argued that measures finalized under Trump will not be easy to remove, just as his administration struggled to reverse some policies put in place by previous administrations. 
“In some distant, long-off future time when a Democrat is president, as we all have seen firsthand it is a difficult, complex and time-consuming thing to remove a regulation or a longstanding memorandum,” Miller said in an interview. 
The non-government Migration Policy Institute estimates that the administration has made more than 400 immigration policy changes. A separate tally by advocacy groups puts the figure closer to 1,000. 
The Biden campaign has established an immigration policy working group of volunteers composed of former government officials and immigration advocates. Amy Pope, a former homeland security adviser in the administration of former President Barack Obama, is playing a lead role, according to four people familiar with the effort. 
Several of the people said they were concerned about Pope’s involvement. While Obama did not invoke anti-immigrant rhetoric or attempt to curtail legal immigration, some 3 million immigrants were deported between 2009-2016, earning him the moniker “deporter in chief” from angry activists. Biden served as Obama’s vice president during that period. 
In a 2018 interview, Pope defended Obama’s decision to expand the detention of migrant families arrested at the border. 
The campaign declined to provide Reuters a list of the volunteers. Pope did not respond to a request for comment. 
Biden plans to send an immigration bill to Congress on his first day in office that includes a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally, according to campaign adviser Alex. The bill also would address the status of “Dreamers” who were brought to the United States as children but are now in the country illegally. 
Biden previously pledged to undo Trump’s travel ban on “Day 1” of his presidency, but that would now be slated for his first 100 days in office, according to Alex. The ban blocks a range of travelers from 13 countries, most of which are either majority-Muslim or African nations. 
These bans could be easily undone, as they were issued by executive order and presidential proclamation, the policy experts said, although any changes could be delayed by lawsuits from some conservatives. 
One policy that would be more difficult to undo is Trump’s so-called “public charge” rule, which makes it harder for poorer immigrants - those who receive certain public benefits or are deemed likely to do so - to obtain permanent residence. 
The rule was blocked nationwide by a federal judge in July for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency, but that injunction was later narrowed by an appeals court to apply to just three states. 
To remove the rule, a Biden administration would need to issue another regulation to rescind it unless Congress addressed it in legislation or courts invalidated it, regulatory experts said. 
The fate of Trump’s immigration legacy also would depend on the makeup of Congress after the Nov. 3 elections. If Democrats retain control of the House of Representatives and wrest the Senate from Republicans they will wield more power to push through their agenda. 
But even then it might not be easy. Trump failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature health care reform law, even as his party controlled the House and Senate during the first two years of his presidency. 
Reporting by Ted Hesson in Washington, editing by Ross Colvin and Grant McCool","Placards lining the road into Kamala Harriss ancestral family village in southern India display her photograph with the caption Singa Pennae,"" or Lioness.""The phrase from a female power ballad in a popular Tamil-language movie released last year signaled the excitement in some parts of India over her nomination as the Democratic vice presidential candidate on a ticket with Joe Biden. Her family is confident that Harris, the first Black and Indian-American woman on a major presidential party ticket, will win over the rest of a country that has moved closer to the U.S. thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modis close ties with Donald Trump.
Indians love drama, which explains President Trumps popularity in India,"" said Harriss maternal uncle, Gopalan Balachandran, an academic based in New Delhi. But I am confident that she will be equally popular.""
Forged by theatrics, the Trump-Modi bond culminated in two giant stadium events in front of tens of thousands of their supporters -- one in Houston last September and the other in Modis home state of Gujarat in February. And while the warming relations have not yet resolved a trade spat, India has expanded arms purchases from the U.S. and aligned with it more openly against China.
The Trump administration has made India a key part of its Free and Open Indo-Pacific"" strategy, and backed Modis government following deadly clashes between Chinese and Indian troops along their disputed Himalayan border in June. India is also a key part of the informal regional grouping to counter China known as the Quad, which also includes the U.S., Japan and Australia.
Still, the closer ties between the U.S. and India are likely to persist in a Biden-Harris White House, said Amitabh Mattoo, a former member of Indias National Security Council Advisory Board.
They may not roll out a red carpet or give bear hugs or talk about each other in narcissistic terms, but I dont think there will be substantial shift in the importance that Washington has for India -- that will remain,"" said Mattoo, the author of more than a dozen books on international relations and a professor at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University. Biden is unlikely to do anything reckless in terms of changing posture as long as the China threat remains.""
A spokesman for the Biden-Harris campaign referred to Bidens plan to place a high priority on continuing to strengthen the U.S.-India relationship."" The campaign declined to comment further.
Frayed Nerves
India-U.S. ties have advanced under previous Democratic administrations. In March 2000, President Bill Clinton looked past Indias nuclear tests to begin developing a stronger bilateral relationship. Under the George W. Bush administration, Biden helped pilot the civil nuclear cooperation with India in the Senate as chair of the foreign relations committee.
And though relations soured after the arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York in 2013, Barack Obama mended ties soon after Modis election. The leaders sat for hours together in the rain as Obama become the first U.S. president to be the official chief guest"" at Indias Republic Day parade.
Trump has hit India on trade while avoiding more controversial issues. While in New Delhi in February, Trump said hed raised the issue of religious freedom with Modi, but declined to comment on demonstrations against the governments new citizenship law discriminating against Muslims. Hes also offered to mediate"" between India and its rival Pakistan on Kashmir after Modi ended decades of autonomy in Indias only Muslim-majority state.
Harris has expressed more concern about Modis actions, which has led to a lengthy crackdown in Kashmir and nationwide street protests earlier in the year over the citizenship law.
We have to remind Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world,"" Harris said in September 2019 while on the campaign trail. We are keeping track of the situation. There is a need to intervene if the situation demands."" A Biden campaign policy paper outlining his outreach toward Muslim Americans criticized India over Kashmir and the citizenship law, while in a statement released earlier this month he said he would stand by India in confronting the threats it faces along its borders.
Strategic Relations
Despite those issues, Modis ruling Bharatiya Janata Party said the U.S. and India have deep strategic relations"" supported widely across party lines in both countries.
As far as the BJP is concerned, we are naturally happy that someone with Indian ancestry is contesting the second topmost post in USA,"" Vijay Chauthaiwale, chief of foreign affairs in the party who helped organize the Namaste Trump event in Gujarat in February, said in a text message.
